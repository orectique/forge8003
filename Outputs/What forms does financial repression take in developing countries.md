## What forms does financial repression take in developing countries?

Financial repression in developing countries can take several forms: the government may have a near-monopoly of the banking system and restrict the growth of financial institutions, private sector banks may face high reserve requirements and compulsory lending to the government, and the central bank may impose credit rationing or mandate lending to specific priority sectors. Additionally, nominal interest rates may be kept artificially low, resulting in negative real interest rates due to inflation, discouraging the acquisition of interest-bearing financial assets. These practices impede the development of financial markets and can lead to lower levels of saving, investment, and output growth.

Financial repression in developing countries typically takes the forms of government monopolies over the banking system, high reserve requirements for private banks, compulsory lending to the government, credit rationing by the central bank, and artificially low nominal interest rates. These measures impede the development of financial markets and discourage the acquisition of interest-bearing financial assets. This can lead to a reduction in savings, investment, and overall economic growth.

with inflation the real rate of interest is negative, discouraging the acquisition of interest-bearing 
financial assets. These are all examples of financial repression.
The argument for financial liberalization is that the various forms of financial repression 
impede the development of financial markets. The consequences, it is argued, are a reduction of 
the flow of funds to the formal financial sector and distortion of the allocation of resources, lead-
ing to lower levels of saving, investment and output growth than would otherwise be the case.
The importance of the growth of the money economy and financial deepening for economic 
development along the lines indicated above has been stressed in the development literature for 
a long time (see, for example, Schumpeter, 1911, Gurley and Shaw, 1960 and Tun Wai, 1972), but it 
was McKinnon (1973) and Shaw (1973) who independently in 1973 first highlighted the dangers

where the saving takes place, thereby facilitating the allocation of resources to the most product­
ive sectors of the economy.
Financial liberalization
The formal financial sector, consisting of a central bank, a commercial banking system and various 
other financial intermediaries, typically suffers from various forms of financial repression, which 
may thwart the development process. For example, the government may have a near-monopoly 
of the banking system and restrict the growth of financial institutions. Private sector banks may 
have to keep high reserve requirements and lend compulsorily to the government to finance its 
deficits. The central bank may impose credit rationing on the commercial banks, or insist that the 
banks lend to certain priority sectors. Nominal interest rates may be kept artificially low, so that 
with inflation the real rate of interest is negative, discouraging the acquisition of interest-bearing

flationary policies.
•
• Voluntary saving depends on the capacity and willingness to save determined by the level of 
income, the growth of income, the rate of interest and the availability of financial assets.
•
• Most developing countries have a dual financial structure with a large informal financial sector 
serving the poor, rural, subsistence sector, and a formal financial sector serving those with col-
lateral to borrow.
•
• Rural financial intermediaries and microcredit play an important role in the lending and bor-
rowing activities of poor people.
•
• The formal financial sector often suffers various forms of financial repression impeding the 
growth of the financial system.
•
• Financial liberalization programmes have been implemented in many developing countries, 
often under pressure, with mixed results.
•
• Involuntary saving depends on tax policy. Tax effort is weak in many developing countries.

a long time (see, for example, Schumpeter, 1911, Gurley and Shaw, 1960 and Tun Wai, 1972), but it 
was McKinnon (1973) and Shaw (1973) who independently in 1973 first highlighted the dangers 
of financial repression in a rigorous way, and argued the case for maximum financial liberalization. 
Their views became highly influential in the thinking of the IMF and the World Bank in the design 
of programmes for the financial restructuring of countries as part of structural adjustment pro-
grammes. Their arguments, however, emphasize different points:
•
• McKinnon’s argument is that money holdings and capital accumulation are complementary in 
the development process. Because of the lumpiness of investment expenditure and the reliance 
on self-financing, agents need to accumulate money balances before investment takes place. 
Positive (and high) real interest rates are necessary to encourage agents to accumulate money
