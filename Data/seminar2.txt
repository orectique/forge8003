SPEAKER 1
Remember that one? That is the, uh he got a Nobel prize for that one. And, uh, in fact, later on, we can see that he has the second part of his remarks Talking about why it matters in a way. But the focus more on the role of agricultural, uh, agricultural economics. They refer to more, but anyway, I think it the remarks is very clear. Right? And we would know much of the economics that really matter. And, uh so So in that case, I think that is highlighting the importance of the subject. Right for this, uh, for this course, the second one is that, uh is what I also got a You know, another remarks from, uh, from the textbook, right from uh, Professor S was saying that referring to John Mayer Keys about, uh, his view about how attractive this right of the things that draw him to attention to the, uh or in fact, his whole career development into economic. What is that? I'm sure someone will know that one was a yes. It is the combination of a That's right. But what is the expression that he used? That's right. Is the potentiality for good, Right? So in that case, perhaps learning economics and not just, uh, you know, treat it as a dry subject. Right? And John and keys were saying that, you know, there's a potentiality for good about that. Good. If we can understand, right for learning economics of development, we can say it is so important because what linking back to the first remark by Professor Shu. Now we know that how we can combine this one, But also I like to draw your attention. The potentiality for good is that, uh, you know, there are certain things involved in the so called the normative analysis. Basically, about, uh, the value right, the judgement and also be compassionate in a way, in learning the subject but in a way, thinking about all the ways the belief that the subject matter can be applied in real world, right, and to improve the living standard of the well being of the people and the majority of them are living in developing country. So linking back that one is actually are also very important dimension And to begin with in learning this course. Right? And, uh, but also, perhaps I can push you thinking a bit further, seeing that the potentiality for good is not just for the for the outside world, but against, I guess, uh, in, uh, John mainland Kansas, Uh, his, uh, his thinking that the potentiality for good is also for the human being themselves or just for us as well. So think about that one, perhaps down the track. And maybe towards the end of the lecture, I will challenge you more about how you being yourself being transformed in a way in learning the subject and the good for for the outside world and for the human being, for example, or for the development, but also somehow that also for for for yourself in the way. So if you think about that way. I think it's not just about the motivation for learning, but also seeing that the importance of learning can apply to ourselves. So this dimension is very important. It changed your perspective. It changed the way you're looking at the learning. And the importance of learning is, is that clear? And, of course, in lecture one, we emphasise the again the productivity. You know, the, uh the, uh the, uh and the strategy of, uh, why the, uh, you know, the developing countries, especially in the face of or the aftermath of the, uh, covid uh uh, pandemic and, uh to draw and, uh, their attention to make adjustment about the strategy. And so you refer to that one. That's, uh, the summary about, uh, of course, we raised the question right. The important question towards the end of lecture one that the three question being asked is that What is that? Can the poor country ever, you know, got the opportunity to catch up right? These are very significant. The question because those questions is very much related to what we are going to learn, right? Starting from, uh, from this way. And those questions is about a big gap between the rich and the poor. So therefore, the room for catching up is larger. And, uh so, uh, this is also being called the advantage of being poor or the being backward, right? In a way, the second one is that we know this is actually related to today's discussion about the TFP. Right. The second one is about the resource shift effect, right? When when the society as a whole, when you move the resources from a certain area, right, the low productivity area into higher one, then you have a net gains in terms of the overall productivity and output. And I'll give you the example at the time about the urbanisation, right? Uh, in China as an example to show you the, uh why that is important. The third one is the more complicated. And the reason why the poor country can catch up more quickly in a way is because of what can anyone remember Just the ministry return of productivity is the, uh, that's right. Related to what very important ratio convergence is, uh is very much related. Yes, that's exactly what the capital labour ratio. So some questions from, uh anyway somewhere for all our

SPEAKER 3
students.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, but but are you happy to raise questions anytime? All right, just to switch on. And, uh so we will address your questions. Yeah. Come for this. So that is the third one is the more complicated involving some fundamental, the principle of economy. Basically, it is the diminution return to capital. The rich country have a higher capital labour ratio so that they tend to have, uh, you know, the capital is a subject to diminution return, so it tend to grow slower. And for poor country, they have a low capital labour ratio. So therefore they are not subject to diminishing return to capital. So in that case, they can grow much faster or catching up more quickly. And this is related to the convergence of story. But we can talk about that later on when we talk about economic growth. So that means it's a hopeful. The poor country, potentially in theory, is a hopeful being catching up, right. But however we are facing in reality, so much constraint right facing those countries. But some countries did very well as we know the East Asian economy, but majority of the country are not doing well even though they have a relatively low capital labour ratio. Right? And so that's the question about the lecture one. Now, let me give you a very brief summary about the lecture tool. And let me ask, Have you listened to the recorded lecture lecture? Two. Very good. Thank you. And, uh, so very, very brief summary about that one. This lecture focused on the underdevelopment, right? And, uh, there's a several elements to it. Number one, I think it's very important to know the key characteristics of underdevelopment. Right? The key characteristic. So all these things are related The discussion in subsequent discussion in the lecture, all of them, and so therefore it's important, though the fact right with that one we know within that one we know the very importantly, is the importance of what importance of a capital accumulation right importance of a capital accumulation, why, that is important. That of course related to saving but also related to the concept of the so called the vicious circle right. In a way, the vicious circle is what lack of capital investment will lead towards a low productivity and the low productivity will lead to a low output and the low output, a little lower income and the lower income Very least towards the the low saving and the saving. Low saving where again, you know, come back to you because you lack of capital for investment. Yes, it is.

SPEAKER 2
Sorry, I just one of my friends. Watching the audio is not great.

SPEAKER 1
I see. I don't know if I want to see the light in the way. Oh, ok. Is that better enough for our students?

SPEAKER 3
Can you give us some suggestions? Can you feel the audio is better now?

SPEAKER 4
It's better.

SPEAKER 1
It's OK. Very good. Thank you. Thank you. Is that OK for good on you? Thanks. Yeah. So this is a vicious circle in a way. And, uh, which affects the, uh, their development process. And also, if you're linking the, uh, the capital accumulation, and, uh, towards the end of the lecture, we mentioned about the two, theory, right? The car, those, uh, uh, law, but also the ross of the stage of development. So, for ro of the stage of development, we can see that, uh, you know, developing country need What? What's the percentage of capital has to be used for investment in order to develop the economy to take off. Excellent. It's a 10% right. You have at least a 10% of many developing country, right? They don't have a 10% of a of a saving to begin with, right? And so in that case, it's not sufficient. Of course. Later on, we know so many countries are refer to the borrowing right. The borrowing in order to fill in the gap, the saving investment in the gap in order to, you know, to to grow. And, of course, that leading towards the other, you know, the debt issues, debt crisis back to 19 eighties. You know, those, uh uh, the Mexico, you know, you know, chile and, uh, Brazil and Argentina Argentina in particular. For those are the cases, you know, for leading towards, uh, some kind of, uh, you know, crisis and through through that one. And, uh, of course, the, uh, we know the, uh we know the, uh a we know the importer. I think in that lecture, we also know the importance of, uh, of a manufacturing sector, right, as compared with the the rural or the agricultural sector. So why, that is what's the most important distinction between these two sectors? Why is it important for a developing country? You know, progressing towards, uh, from agricultural or the primary industry towards the secondary industry?

SPEAKER 5
The agriculture sector is characterised by an increasing return.

SPEAKER 1
The secondary industry, the manufacturing is increasing. But let me ask you a further question. And you are saying that the primary industry is subject to diminish return, right? Why? Why? Why? Agricultural production is subject to diminish return. Excellent. Excellent. So I think I hope you all know that the content is because of what agricultural production is. The is the is A is a subject to diminishing return. Is it? Because of what? That the production itself is reflecting the nature of that production. Basically, land is being regarded as a fixed in supply. Right? You don't increase the land like other things. But when you added the production the variables which is the labour or other materials into the fixed factor production, they all combined with the fixed factor product which is the land that production is a subject diminish return. So if you look at the charts in the in the lecture, that reflecting that one. So it will be very good for the country to move more quickly from agricultural to industry. Right. And by doing so, we can see that, uh, linking to the following, uh, cost content. That is the structural changes right over time. Now, let me answer quickly. What's the main determinant of the, uh of the structure change? You know, moving from agriculture into industry. Just have a question. Yes, it is in our agricultural production function.

SPEAKER 3
So man is man is regard as one of the one of the product. But we do not our product function that say we only have capital and labour. But why we just land well in the agricultural sector,

SPEAKER 1
you cannot eliminate land. Land is the most important input of the factor in the general production function. You can do it. The capital labour, right? And the you know, the TFP and other things. But in case of agricultural land is a very important input there.

SPEAKER 3
Like, you know, in US, they they they kind of like to make it into bridge. Let's say around around, or like bridge, we can go

SPEAKER 1
much further in answering that question that is basically related to recording, recording a theory and about the fertility and of the land. Usually you basically cultivated the best land available to you. But, however, if there's a real shortage of of food, so that means the farmers will have a motivation to expand the land into less fertile land. So by doing so, the price of, uh that will have to be increased so very, very difficult. So, yeah, quality. Sorry. The productivity of the land is a much more complex in a way, but here we are talking about overall agricultural productivity. It's not the land productivity. Even though we are, just assume land. The supplies in is a fixed, and you're talking about the overall productivity. Anyway, let's back to the question. Yeah, thank you for that one. Raising the So what is the determinant of the structure? Change from agricultural into industry? Excellent. Is the income a ST of demand for particular goods? Right, That's a that's a very good you have to know that one. That's the only single determinant of the structural changes from agricultural into industry towards further to what to the tertiary industry that the service industry is all being determined by one, but the income analysis of demand for that particularly good. I'll give you one example about why agriculture is somehow being disadvantaged right in the lectures. If I remember correctly, you know the output increase of income people's income increases about 3% right, and then you have a 1.1 0.5% of increase in the productivity. And, uh, so when you get this to you have a you can you can think about the income analysis of demand, probably by is a 00.5 and so, by doing so, the potential the potential production or income growth is about a 3%. But if the income A demand is a lower is only 0.5% and the total demand for agricultural production is only 1.5% so refer to the lecture notes is all there. So therefore, you leave a gap 3% income increase, but only the demand for the agricultural product is only 1.5% so there's a gap there. That gap leads to so called under employment and in some cases, the stagnation and, uh, in the uh, in the sector. So therefore, why industry is a subject to the increasing return. Because the people's income increases all of their income. They will demand more manufacturing goods. Right, You name it. You know, when the agriculture went very poor, the demand is is much more limited to the necessities. And so what is the law of that one? All of the income increase. You spend the most of your income for the necessities the food, water shelters. So what is the law of that one? No, it's the anger law, right? UN law. That means the poor country have a low. Those are kind of income. And so the majority of the income is being spent on the necessities. But once the per capita income increases over time, so what do you do? You, you you start demanding much. All right, the industrial goods and the one day the further development. That's a good example to show that, uh when they when we learn the history of economic development in case of East Asia and China, Japan and Korea, there's an example about those demand changes, right? From a very early on back to fifties and sixties right. So the the industrial goods is What is the watches, Bicycles and the sewing machines. Right. But increasingly, when the income increases, people start demanding what I see. OK? Yeah. And, uh oh, the lights in my eyes. And, uh so that here. So then you start, you know, demanding much more, right? You know, the TV S and the refrigerators and, uh, and now the washing machine and the air conditioning. And then now you know the cars and all that, so you can see the demand for those goods are increasing because what the income analysis of demand for industrial goods is increasing and it is much higher than the agricultural one. So of course, when the demand is higher, the supply will match that one. So the growth of the industry will happen when the when people become more affluent, what they do, they will demand more. Right, nowadays you can see the services sector, right, entertainment, health, travelling and all these things are very much related to the people's demand. But based on what based on the further increase of their income. So once you remember, that is one factor, right or determinant for the structural changes it all the way. You can explain agricultural industry to the services sector, so that's a That's a That's an important one. OK, please remember, in fact, you can actually explain uh, many other the consumption. Uh, the the change of consumption pattern is also being being part of that one. So towards the end, we have this, uh, the structural changes going on. And, uh, so you will be able to explain why that the structural changes is going on and why this is important and for economic development and towards the end, of course, we have, uh, the the RO, the stage of development in the tutorial discussion. You were focused on that one. And we have also car those law and the car. Those law is also importantly, it is also important, in a way, because that can have a three relationship right being built. What are they? OK, let me tell you, there is a positive relationship between, uh, manufacturing a growth of manufacturing with the, uh with the growth of GDP. So the secondary industry increase that will enhance the GDP growth. Second one, that is, uh, there's also the positive correlation between what? The manufacturing growth of manufacturing to the productivity within the manufacturing sector. That's important, right? Why the the industry being development that can actually help to improve the productivity of that sector? The third one is what the third one is again. The growth of a manufacturing sector is positively correlated with what with the general productivity level outside the manufacturer. That means the overall productivity level is also being enhanced by the secondary industry. The development that including the agricultural sector so therefore the very importantly I think, in the way the agriculture is a is A is a kind of a bottleneck for many developing countries. In Africa, for example, after in the post war period, there's a wave of development and massively supported by international agencies like the World Bank and uh and uh for agri for the for the development. But from time to time we can see the continent the aggregate the overall economy is still being low. The level of development may be low, but then they they find it's not just so much about the foreign aid. It actually is about getting the agricultural sector right, right, and once the reason why the whole continent, the development being dragged down Is it because of, uh, very much lack of agricultural development? But now you are in a position to explain why it's important if you can link it back to the development of strategy. Right? That's one of the issue, or even the case study to show why, you know, getting agriculture sector right is is important. One of the the exam questions that we have previously is is for you to argue why the agricultural productivity improvement holds the key. This is important for the overall development because without agricultural, we see the lecture, those, uh, interaction between the agriculture and industry. Right. So we see that the link and from both the supply side and the demand side So you can explain that one quite well. In a way, I think that's all about the lecture lecture to any question about the lecture tool. No, Again, I think the point is, uh, is, uh, important, you know. Please do listen to the recorded lecture before you come. So, uh, what I did have discussed will make much more sense when you listen to to record lecture or if it is too time consuming, you can at least go quickly hit the lecture. NOs right, Lecture knows is quite easy to handle, right, rather than spend two hours listening And anyway, so no any questions? Let me repeat the key point again. You know, be the changes. The room changes is accommodating because in the second hour we have a group discussion so we can spread out that one second one, that is, there's no attachment of the any scores, right for the case study the group that no more. We have just the rather informal, but in a way. But I let me emphasise this again. It's a very important I will be participating in some group discussion, and also I'll give you a summary. And after your presentation, the presentation. The group can nominate some representative, but you can also, uh, if you have time like we have more people to speak OK on those issues. The third one is that, uh, from now on, this week is a bit special because we already mentioned about the TFP. Sorry. So in case study in the second hour of the day, we focus on that one issue, OK, but from next week, the old the case study will follow the, uh, similar topic. All right, so therefore, it is a more consistent in a way, but also as a way to digest the call. Uh, the similar, uh uh, topic. But in the tutorial on Friday, that is also very much related to back to the lecture. The tutorial question. Can you see the point? So the case study linking to the seminar and the tutorial discussion linking back to the lectures. And of course, there's overlapping. OK, basically strengthening our view on that one. So is that clear? Yeah, OK, very good. So in that context, let me introduce Uh uh, Nicola is our, uh, another tutor, Uh, for for the course. So on friday, Uh, Nicola, we we handle the, uh the morning session, the tutorial and the 20 year We handle the afternoon. Uh, tutorial session. OK? Yeah. Uh, thanks. Uh uh, NCO for your help. Uh, OK, so if there is no question, let's focus on the, uh, on the similar discussion again. This is related to one of the, uh, topic for for for essay writing your essay. And, uh, and also I think it's important. Remember, I sent a message to water and seeing that the way of basically is the is the way to handle the case study. Right? So can anyone remember the key elements of that? Because when we go through the topic, we try to apply those, uh, those elements, right? Number one, that's it's not in the lecture. It's in my message when we change the way Our arrangement for organising the the case studies political opinion. What is the what? There's a four elements. Perhaps later I saw this actually missing one, which is, I can add it now. The first element is that is the clear ident identification of issue identifying issue. It is very important in doing all this academic work not just for the case study, but also importantly for your writing, your written assignment. It's also important for writing your essay. It's also important in answering a most substantial question part B in the final exam, which involve a lot of thinking, right, So identify the issue. For example, when the when the question being given you immediately think what is the key question there? You ask a question right to understand that issue which is so important. So once you have done that one, what do you do immediately? You're thinking about what? What sort of analytical approach I can apply in. Handle this, this question analytical approach. And the third one is that what the third one that you actually come up with, the so called the policy instrument right? The policy tools to be able to what to be able to to tackle those issues, using that framework, lot of a debate, some discussion, right? The issue are clearly identified. Then they certainly quickly jump to what to the policy and implication. But we don't really have analytical content or analytical approach. Many students are liking of that one. So that's why it is important to have analytical contents, right? And before you really put on the or thinking about the actual policy tools so analytical context, we will have a session probably next week between a seminar and case study. 15 minutes are very useful to give us some kind of a guidance and about how to write. All right, so the third element is the tool, but and then the final one is about organising evidence, right, organising the evidence or the data in the way. And for example, when we later on discuss the role of TV. So we know how we handle that one. I'll give you the summary later on for that one. But today's, uh of course, the final elements which I missed in my message, is what is the lessons I had have been learned? And after all this analysis, you come up with the the key lessons, right? And, uh, we again you can refer to, uh to it as a implication, uh, policy implication as well. So the reason why I want to emphasise in this one is that because when we go through this, a similar topic is basically you can apply with using using a case study approach. Right. So follow that one. In addition to that one, I think in that process, especially during the group group discussion, so actively engaging in discussion not only in the case study, but also Friday The tutorial is the same thing when you're actually participating and, uh, the in discussion, you learn a lot from others as well, right? And in a reflective way. And, uh so so that that's the, uh the part of learning. Now, let's see the the the case study the the curse of natural resources. Very important phenomenon being identified by economies in the somehow the post war development. And so what is the issue? For example, let me ask you. So when the curse of resources, what are the key issues evolve in here? The issue is that when you have a sitting on the rich resources right of a country and normal thinking is what you will be rich, right? The country will tend to be get rich, right? Yeah, that's right. And, uh, you you you You have this kind of expectation, right? And, uh, but in reality, when, uh when Jeffrey Sachs and, uh, and Warner, they come up with the average, Uh uh, you know, the the economic analysis. The result actually shows that no, it's not the case. On average, when the you know the when the country tend to have a rich in resources, their average growth rate is tend to be below the average. It tend to be slow. Actually, in a way, that's a puzzle, right? That's actually, you know, in contrary to our thinking about when you have oil and minerals and and land. You tend to get rich right in a way, but it's not the case. So that's the issue, right? When you think about that one, it's rather paradoxical in a way. Immediately, you will think, Wow, we need to find the reason for that, right? So so approaching this issue is a is a real issue, by the way. It's a real world issue, and it's affecting so many countries and those countries from A from a Pacific, for example, right, and, uh, from Africa, from the Middle East and even for Latin America country. So those countries are very rich in resources, but it didn't deliver a relative high growth. And as that and in the in some V the country within the you know, like China, for example, some some provinces have a very rich in resources, but they are somehow like the very far behind for that one. So those kind of approach is also applied to the different regions within the country as a part of a regional development, the gui, for example. Now it's catching up a bit. I used to be so rich in resources, but never got opportunity, you know, to to take off in terms of economic development. But again, you can also think about those countries which have a relative poor are poor in resources. What? Who are they? Which country of that Singapore is a typical example, right? And, uh, Japan is also relative poor in resources and, uh, Korea. I have some coal and answer, but it's a very much a lacking of resources and in the way. But those countries somehow perform so well in the post war period, right? And as a East Asia, as a as a kind of a model for economic growth, not based on a very rich in resources, but based on something else. We can talk about those strategy and later on. And, uh so that's a That's an issue, right? So when you identify that issue or in the way to pose the question why that is the case, why is it the case? Then you try to find out the, uh, the reason for that. And now the next step is to find the analytical approach right. What sort of a theory we need to have in terms of all the analytical framework we need to have in order to explain this a typical phenomenon. And that phenomenon continues until now. Right? But some countries are doing very well later on. If you can use that as a case study, right, Australia compared with Argentina, as one example more than 100 years ago, you know, the per capita income coming to this The per capita income of these two countries more or less is the same. But you can now see that what's the difference is right now, both countries are very rich in resources, right? So, uh and, uh, Canada is another example North America and Botswana, and, uh, is also a very good example as compared with, uh, Nigeria. Yeah, in in sub Sahara, Norway is again. There's a very typical example with oil and gas, right, and doing so well. But for Norway, perhaps also, there's a very, very unique approach and reflecting those development, which is the one, in fact, the both one is the same thing when you have a very vast income resulting from, uh, you know, exploration of the natural resources. So what do you do with the income you got? That's right. So many many countries just got wasted, but also provide some so much opportunity for rent seeking, meaning what? The corruption, right irregularity. And somehow, in many cases in the past, multinational corporations also make things worse because they are very powerful in a way to influence the domestic politics. Uh, in their favour. In terms of that, you know the process of, uh, you know, exploration, though that makes things worse. Then immediately you were thinking about, uh, certain mechanism right is happening and why those subjects are so prone to those kind of irregularities rent seeking. And while some countries are did so well to use the wealth right to work for what purpose? For education, for infrastructure, right for the capacity building. So all these things that can change or transform the country because of the income for so many countries, just a wasted for that one. And in Norway, plus one, for example, in Australia Now you know resource, you know, is booming. And especially during 2002 3 to 2013 that 10 years, they called it a super cycle of the of the the resources right as enormous against in terms of income and the royalties and the income. So what do you do with that one? The money is a sudden surge in income. What do you do with that one? Can you put aside for some money, right? For the future development, that's probably the best way. But if you do have a political system which allow you, you know to do so and the money tend to be, you know, competed away in a way that the rent seeking because when you have a rent, it basically motivated the people or company or individuals, or even corrupt the government officials, you know, to take a share of that one. This is the rent seeking activity. Rent seeking activity is a very, uh, very wasteful in the way for the society as a whole. So what is the form for a country to put aside the money you know, to be accumulated for future development for future use? This is a so called the wealthy, a sovereign wealth fund. Being this sovereign wealth fund is being established in Norway, for example, I can't remember now. It's a trillions of trillions of dollars, a huge amount, and that fund is a massive investor in the global financial market, so generate a high returns of that one. But also the future generation can benefit that one. But also very importantly, the government has no say to that sovereign wealth fund that Means is independently operate independently from a government. If it is not independent, the government can can do it right at their discretion. So it's not a pure, very important, you know, in as an independent one.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, well, there's a maybe a different arrangement, but in

SPEAKER 1
case the government has really need the money, right, So maybe it's a certain arrangement in Australia. You know, we can see that that the fund is being again independent, uh, operated in a way. But the head of the fund is always thinking No, always resisting any kind of a government intervention into that the fund and for the future use so. But anyway, both one also is a good a good example. A good case study for doing that one. Now let's come back a bit about about those mechanism. That's the second element, right? We need what we need. Analytical approach, right, and for us, we need some kind of economic insight in looking at what's actually going on, and, uh, those, uh, we can skip that one. So those are the channels. When you list those channels, you immediately thinking about all the things that are related. Those are theory or the analytical approach to those issues, right? Wages, for example, the cost of production. Yeah, why? Why we just matter here when you have a particular sector in the society, in the economy is booming so that a sector will attract more resources into it. Right, of course, when the when the minerals, the IO and being sold at a very high international price. So what do you do? You tend to pour in the resources into the production of the minerals. I offer example that attract what? When you attract people or workers and engineer coming into that sector, they tend to boost the wages, right? It's good or not. Not good. Good, good for wages. People working in the in the, uh, in that sector, whether it's a good thing or not. Good thing when the wages are going up as a result of the booming of a particular sector, it's not a good way.

SPEAKER 3
And in my in my country states, Um because it's a very concentrated industry. Um, that's a very limited amount of human culture. And, uh, and the we is other fields. So it is a good or not good.

SPEAKER 1
It really depends on what it depends on the relationship between this sector and the rest of the economy. If the wages of in that sector is is increasing, resulting from the things I just described everyone else. The wages also tend to be increased. So if you are a domestic entrepreneur, you employ people working. That means you have to pay higher salaries of your employees to match that one right. Otherwise, you know, those sector attracted so much talent right into sector. So everyone else we suffer. So the on average, when the wages are increasing, that means the cost of production for many other sectors of the economy also increasing, right. So which is actually lower the competitiveness of the of the industry? A A apart from the, uh, the resource sector, this is a typical phenomenon. This is actually can be an economic issue. Now, Now you can understand that the wage changes and the competitiveness and also did not mention that one. Yeah, the competitive. That's another one. This is related to the the sixth, the fifth point, which is the entrepreneurship. That means the entrepreneurs have to pay high salary to attract the people that will increase their cost and especially those that start up right. You know, very difficult to survive in a way, the wage cost In lecture one, we also refer to another phenomenon, which is the cost for the capitalist. Right, Remember, Did I mention that one? Oh, I'm confused anyway. So that is the due to the the agricultural protection agricultural protection back to 18 centuries in UK when you have this landlord benefit so much about that protection. But how, however, the emerging capitalist, the collapse right, they had a you know, there is the future, right and, uh, being somehow very much affected because of they have to pay much high salary for workers to survive for themselves and also their families because of that one. But once that the corn law being repealed and the agricultural goods being imported from continental Europe into England, they drags down all agricultural prices that there is a booming capitalism class in a way And, of course, later on you can see the industrial Revolution and everything that happened right is due to the policy change in the way and, uh, the same thing here when you have a high wages again, you know, entrepreneurs are they are suffering, right? They're losing that one now, the second mechanism again. This is a approach, right? We're talking about the competitiveness of the society as a whole and, uh, why the exchange rate changes as a result of, uh, the resource boom. A country's exchange rate also changes. It tend to be appreciated or depreciated as a result of a booming sector. Of course, the currency will be appreciated, right? Like Australian dollars, a 10 year period, right? And 2003 and 2, 2013, and, uh, Australian. Actually, dollar surpassing the the parity with the US. That means it's worth more and, uh, than the US dollars. And why is that? Because the global demand for the resources are so high. So demand for your currency also high. So you tend to appreciate your currency. I was travelling. I remember clearly is to the United States Uh uh 2020 12 so that a booming period. So when we have Australian dollars spending there, we feel more comfortable, right, because it's worth more than US dollar at the time. But now it's a 65 cents, right? So that's the resulting from that one. Why the appreciation of a currency is not good for domestic industry because other manufacturing sector, their competitiveness, tend to be eroded by the appreciation of your currency, right? So because it's so expensive of selling your goods right in a way, the overseas market. So, of course, later on, I think in the lecture 11 or 1011 11. When we talk about the balance of payments, constraint, economic growth and that exchange rate and also the falling one, the terms of trade will be incorporated in that model. To explain why, for those countries who suffer from a balance of payments of difficulties and, uh uh, to subject to these changes, right. But right now you can see that the resource demand tend to appreciate your currency and appreciation of your currency, tend to enjoy the competitiveness of your industry. Of course, this is not good. We good for one sector, but not good for the rest of the economy. All right, so so that's another one. Terms of trade. What is terms of trade? Sorry. What is the terms of trade? Yeah. Is the export prices over import prices? Why, in terms of trade is important export prices or import price? When you have a resource boom, the export sector tend to be, you know, very, very much improved right in the export prices over import prices. So the terms of trade improvement is a net gain in terms of income, the welfare all right. There's another source only two sources for enhancing the country's warfare in the in the truest sense. Terms of trade is one of them. How about the other one? All in two, when you have a factor of production added to that one, you have a factor. Return. So there are. They won't they won't add it right? The actual the value to it. But the two sources are important. Terms of trade is one. How about the other one? I'll give you a hint that's related to next hour discussion about, uh, in our case study, Let me tell you, is the productivity improvement so remember only these two Productivity improvement without productivity, almost like all the things have become so difficult and including I'll give you one example right happening in Australia right now, right, high inflation and the cost of living. And, uh and, uh and, uh, the rather STN. The wage changes over time, but somehow the RB the Reserve Bank have to try to control interest in inflation rate by raising the interest rate right. And now we are at a stage. Inflation is coming down. But now the the RB will send a signal saying that if we don't have, we don't see the improvement of productivity very difficult for us to control that inflation in the way. So therefore the wage rises have to be slower to be more for the for the policy to be more accommodating in fighting inflation. So that's just one example to show you that the productivity, the productivity improvement, is very much related to macroeconomic policy. Monetary policy in particular. But productivity is everywhere. Let's discuss in the case study in next hour. OK, about about TFP. Can you remember now the two sources and the second one, of course. The terms of the terms of trade improvement, you can project the average export crisis over the average the import prices for a particular country. You can see the, uh, the trajectory of chain for Australia is extraordinary. Over the 10 year the resource boom period, there's a massive improvement of terms of trade. But however, in theory, when the country, when the improvement of one country's terms of trade, that will be what there will be the deterioration of the terms of F for other countries. For those countries who are importing those resources, they have to pay much higher prices, right? So therefore, that's the import prices for them. So therefore, they are their terms of trade are deteriorating. So yes, please.

SPEAKER 3
Um so terms has nothing to do with the exchange rate because it cancels out the well Well you can

SPEAKER 1
you can do. Let's treat it separately, for example, right in terms of the improvement, the real kind of income. But at the same time, resource boom tend to appreciate your currency, right when appreciate the currency, whether they can offside. That's the question when offside, the important trade is really depends. Now, for example, you have a very much a strong currency in a way that affects the manufacturing sector, right in a way. So the overall impact, perhaps because you suffer the competitiveness of your your your your industries. So in that case, perhaps you off the gain from a terms of trade, right? But you can do do it separately in a way. And also the terms of trade is so strong for those countries. You know, Indonesia is also, you know, Brazil and and Chile and those countries. Whenever they have a terms of trade improvement, they actually somehow improve their kind of a macroeconomic situation in a way. But the net gains it can be, I think it can be, Yeah, you can. You can think about that in 90 games. There's an offsetting due to the appreciation of your currency. OK, but this is a good, good thinking now. That's the terms of trade and the terms of trade and the exchange rate. As I mentioned earlier on, we can build in into a nicer framework and that framework to reflect a certain conditions. The country can do what the country can actually depreciate your currency to improve the competitiveness of the industry. So therefore, in uh uh, enhancing economic growth and terms of trade, sometimes a bit difficult and for developing countries. And can anyone remember in that tool there is a statistic about, uh, because, oh, that's related to this lecture tool, right? The characteristics of a development One characteristic is that the developing countries rely too much on the what on the primary industry, agriculture and resource exporting. But you will see that resource acting actually good, because they can improve your terms of trade. But on average is not the case. OK, at the statistic in this lecture, lecture, two, you can find that page and, uh, is what is it, The 1 100 the past 100 years? What do you observe is that the terms of trade, uh, in relation to the primary industry, agriculture and resources is not improving it actually deteriorating by how much is actually real fact. So I think it is useful to remember that one is a deteriorating in the past 100 years, right? Every year is 0.5. That's also quite substantial. That means terms of trade are not in favour of a of a poor country when they rely on the manufacture sorry, relying on export of agricultural goods and also resources. The 10 year period of from 2003 to 13 I mentioned about a super boom period is is rather special and very much related to the the wave of industrialization of China. 1.4 billion people, and come to a state where the industrial industrialization taking place. There's huge demand on the resources, the energy intensity, the resource intensity, of course, the carbon intensity also increasing over that period. Right? So But overall, it's not so again, that's the story is the consistent linking back to we are. What we argued is about what the structural change, right? So that means the country have to move from the primary industry relying on Prime Minister into the industry because, uh, because on average is, uh, the terms of trade on the, uh, for the, uh, for the menu for the, uh uh uh, agricultural and the primary industry is actually deteriorating. You check the, uh, the textbook and the lecture notes by 0.5 which is quite substantial. Now, the fourth element again. That's the analytical approach, right, by the way. And there's a 22 different kind of approaches. Let me talk about that later on because there's so many elements, right? But for for some, I say you can actually focus on one or related to two or three rather than touch upon all almost everything. And, uh, well, let us discuss that later on. Why economic structure matters here when you have one sector which is a booming, that because of the resource development, right, wider structure. Because I already mentioned right one sector development that will attract the resources right from the rest of the economy into this sector. Right. So the industry tend to be the structure tend to focus on as you mentioned, right, you know, very concentrated on the resource sector for some country. Why easy, right? You dig and you yourself and, uh, and for the development of the but somehow this is also not good. If you're thinking about, you know, the diversity of the industry, right? The structure and the wider, you know, employment, the implication for employment. So that means the, uh, the typical example. Perhaps what is a typical example about, uh, the certain bias in terms of, uh, the the economic structure? Middle East, right? The oil exporting countries, right? Yeah, 70%. 70% in some cases, Probably even more so. The economy is related to oil, right? And the only in recent years. Because one thing is about the climate change. The other part is about the concern about the exhaustion of those resources, the oil. So the and that consciousness, right? And, uh, yesterday I read as a report was seeing that, you know, perhaps, uh, by 2035 in Australia the EV the electrical cars the vehicles will be will be accounting something like 60 67% of the total costs being used. So fairly quickly you can see moving. You will use the petrol anymore in a way. So those economy were suffer, but it was so slow in, in terms of a structural adjustment changes over time because it's easy, right? You just sell oil and get a massive amount of, you know, revenues as a result of that one. But of course, in recent years, they actually start doing that one. I don't know whether you travel from Australia or East Asia to Europe when the aeroplane passing in Dubai, right? That's and the first more than 20 years or nearly 20 years. When I fly to London and I look at the wind from the window, I said No by distance, you shouldn't have such a massive city, the Metropolitan development in the evening. This is all life. I think he shouldn't. It's just some kind of a middle way. It must be very, you know, you won't expect such a kind of a spectacular views from that one. But I asked and they said, It's actually Dubai and now you can see because the diversification, you know, that has become so attractive for tourists and for many other things, right? The beauty. And so the strange feeling at that time I thought, This is a desert right down there. But But this is not so reflecting the country's diversification strategy, right? And it continues to do so. You can see this the scene, but that it can be an issue, not just imagine, you know, oil and no longer people no longer use oil, and those country, without those strategy of diversifying their industry structure, will suffer a lot. And for many other developing countries, smaller players, you know, exporting certain resources and that even more. And for that one, the so entrepreneurship is such an important topic for economic development. So who are they and, uh, what they do and what is important for them. So when you come to the entrepreneurship immediately, you are thinking about, uh, certain people, right or class of people. So what they do it is very much related to innovation and the creativity, innovation and risk taking in a way that somehow very good for the, uh, pushing for the, uh, the frontier and, uh, of the economy, but also generate, uh, employment. And, uh, this is, uh, related. This is the shitter view about entrepreneurship so important. And but somehow, as we mentioned with the resource boom, the rising wages, the appreciation of currency and, uh so it's not good for them, right? That means they have to pay high salary for their workers, you know, increasing their cost of production. So it's not good because of those, Uh, uh, people they need a capital. They need a very much a conducive environment. Basically refer to to what? This is actually the topic for next week, right? Talking about the rules of law and the property rights and the clean government and all these in all, some kind of a constraint on power people in that power position. They are the conditions for the entrepreneurs to flourish in the society. But because of that, it's not so. This the F one. Oh my God, I already So let's finish quickly. Is the misuse of fund rent and rent seeking already mentioned right? That's the provision of public goods because the money being wasted so the money are not being used properly through our building the schools, right, infrastructure, education and for the long term development external factor is the it is a big topic. I have a book not being borrowed by one of the students. It's about the role of a multinational corporation in terms of in relation to resource development. For Latin American countries, you can see there's so much corruption being involved, but it's a good thing because they can bring in the technology and for the exploration. They can train the people and also help with the capacity building. But if you don't have a clean government and clear institution environment, you know it's not working in that way. That's the That's the factor. And, uh, and as a continued struggle, actually, you know, for the small government, small country, small government in dealing with a very powerful multinational corporations and especially in resources, one example of our technology that is the way in Africa and the continent used to be by people, right vehicles to explore or finding the the minerals and the earth Now. But now the multinational company just use the satellite in going through right to detect and find out the mineral resources underneath. So brilliant technology by the big companies right, history of colonisation extractive institution. That one is the, uh, related very famous book. We will refer to that book later on next week when we talk about the institution and, uh, it by as a mo and Robinson. And, uh, the title of the book is called Why Nations Fail. And in That book is the key focus is about that institution institution in both the political and the economic institution and and extractive versus inclusive. It's all about that one in determining the development outcome for many countries or one nation. And, uh so that's basically the channel and Ana scene, right? Now, when you have this being identified, we can we can do the case study, right? We can. I think it's already policy instrument. The third element. I mean, what sort of policy you need, And, uh, And then what is the empirical and the case study you can organise. So the famous one is including those one East Asia lack of resources. But, uh, so much develop right? As a kind of a you know, another set of example. Different outcome from applying the different institution Australia versus Argentina. And, uh, as I mentioned earlier on 100 years ago, per capita income is the same more or less the same resources, even all in the Southern Hemisphere, right? The the locations. And so But now it's a vast difference between two countries, right? In terms of, uh, well, well being and, uh, per capita income. And, uh, it's all because of the institution. North America versus, uh, south, uh, South America. Right And again, you can immediately thinking about North America. What sort of institution? It is basically from a two influence Continental de France, right, And another one is a British institution, but all the way down from Mexico border always down to the far end of South America, is from which country, The institution, the influence the origin of the institution is from what? This one you should know. Spain, right? Is a Spanish influence on the Yeah, So all the all the way down and that determined the differences of the performance. Right again, That's the due to the institution. And, uh, anyway, Africa is very much related to the so called the colonisation, the legacies of colonisation, right. Whereas in in many cases, those countries are shoulder the burden of colonisation still right until now. So you can see the instability and the coups all happen all the time. It is due to the legacies of that one, the different outcome from using different strategies again. Botswana. We already mentioned that example And the diamond, right? All this and Nigeria is so much oil but again so poor still. And so you have this case study using those case study, you apply. Then there's a more or less there You complete this analysis. This is just the one example about the export of resources and, uh which is again against the per capita income right, so you can see rather clear negative correlations. And for that one, you can look at yourself all your income per capita and the and the time under Democratic rules you can see is stuck here, right? Oil income is very high, and it tend to be lower. So this is just one example to show you the approach to those kind of a case study, Right? And, uh, but again, you know, refer to my message and, uh, and then against this, uh, this background And, uh, but we we we will come back to talk about, uh, the the resource curse later on. But, uh, I think now we have, uh, another 40 45 minutes. Let's talk about, uh, let's try the first time the the case study, uh, grows right. I don't think there's so many students here, I think 11 group, the second group, third group, The fourth one, the fifth one, maybe five groups. Right. And let's focus on the what I described in lecture one about the growth, accounting, the tap, how we understand the growth, why the tap is important in the development context. I think I already gave you some example, right? The resource safety effect is one of them. Technology. Technological change is another one. The technical change is another one, but it can be related to innovation and all other things. So let's discuss that one. But have you done the work basically, in thinking about the TFP? Yes or no? Yes. OK, so let's do it. And 20 minutes discussion, maybe 15. So we come back with a representative from each group, at least the one possibly two, to speak on that one. All right. So the coordinator, perhaps perhaps for each group will be the representative. OK, so let's, uh let's do it voluntarily, OK? It's a good practise to coordinate one. So after 15 minutes, we have another 10 or 15 minutes presentation, we learn from each other. Then I use another 10 minutes for me to summarise but not give you the marks for that one is no longer. But I'll give you my assessment about your understanding of the issue and, uh, for online students. Can we create a room for them? Yeah, we have about 22 students and, uh, the similar kind of a requirement for you to to organise can we do that? One and 20 years is creating a rule. So, uh, you have a one? Yeah. Police to police to sit. Yeah. And, uh, I can.

SPEAKER 3
Hi. My students. I will. I think there are a total of 20 students online. Right? I will create three separate groups to have some discussion. So each group I will have 15 minutes to discuss this week's place. That is about the TFP. Right? So after 15 minutes, I will call.

SPEAKER 1
That's a very small group. You can You can You can send one. That doesn't matter.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, more or less. OK, so I will invite you to join the company. You can do this group.

SPEAKER 1
You can form another group up there. Yeah, it is one group over there. Yeah, this is looks very nice.

SPEAKER 3
Very cold.

SPEAKER 1
So you can you can join them pretty bad.

SPEAKER 3
No, they can all always she in. I'll come and see her for students who still remain in the message. Can you join the Did you come?

SPEAKER 1
Uh, last week? I don't know. That's the last one. But you join another group so people will tell you. Yeah, Yeah, I will go through the group OK, for those students. For those students who missed the last week, you probably don't know much, but other people can share the view with you. OK, just join them Information.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, start. I see. Ok, ok, let me let me let me just give

SPEAKER 1
you especially about these, Ok?

SPEAKER 3
Very nice. So one let me give you one very quick summary

SPEAKER 1
all about the last week last week when we describe this the, uh basically the I. In fact today we also emphasising the importance of our productivity. Right? So the productivity can be captured in a unique way. That is what we call the gross accounting right. What is the gross counting? Gross accounting is to specify the relationship between output and import. Right? So output is easy to understand. That's the GDP. That's the growth rate. That's the per capita income and the right hand of equation. We have a two, basically two components. One component is the pure factor of production. What are they? Capital labour. You can also include the lack of resources and the land. But capital labour is the most popular things, right? But in addition to that one, we have another component. What is the component of that? Using a gross accounting framework? Because capital has a certain contribution to output. Right? Normally it's about a percentage 30% or 20% 20 to 30%. Labour has another contribution right towards output. And then when you count the contribution of capital and labour, there's a residual left there, right? What? What we call the residual. That's the contribution, not by the capital or by labour. So therefore we can refer that one to what? That's right. The TFP is the total factor productivity. Why the total factor? Productivity is important is related. Just now we mentioned about the productivity, right? It really But there is so much, so much things right being included. We call this the black box, but for us it doesn't matter. We can just treat it as the way or capture the improvement of productivity. By doing so, let's just this go right to find out what are the key elements? So, in lecture one, I mentioned about the urbanisation, the resource of shift, the effect is one of them. You can also refer to many other things, including the institution. All right. Why the Molo and Robinson said the institution play a key role for the standard of living or the per capita income. Why this institution can be part of that one. Entrepreneurship can be also part of that one. The rules of law, right? Reflecting the good institution is all part of that. So it's a widen our scope from the very beginning to discuss right. In addition to the contribution to growth by capital and labour, we have something else. But sometimes it is very handy to put in the other a TFP. That's why it's called a total factor productivity. And in a textbook in Lecture one, we have all this table right, and to show you the the TFP comparison for the emerging economy, East Asia versus Africa, for example, you can see there's a vast differences in TFP, so using that framework is so handy for us to identify what is lacking in that development. And this is related to last week, a seminar. When I talk about with you about a strategy right, it's the same thing when you get the strategy right, right When you get a strategy right, they can improve right it help to improve the productivity. And when you get a strategy wrong or the development wrong, it suffered like a waste. And the E efficiency. All this related So so the idea of a discussion is just like that one to highlight why this is important and what elements of that one and what sort of strategy government adopt to improve the TFP. And what are the constraints facing those countries in implementing those policy? Is that clear now? Very, very, very good. OK, let's start. And, uh so 10 minutes, 10 to 15 minutes. Quick discussion. And I'd like to see a few views from each group, OK? Yeah, yeah, yeah, a bit of that.

SPEAKER 3
I think it's that. OK, Do you have a coordinator?

SPEAKER 1
That corner? He is, too.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Do you have, uh, that my Look, you don't That's a study already.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, you can start.

SPEAKER 1
You can. That's that's only probably one dimension of that one. And, uh, I just have a summary about what we expect, right? So understand the growth, accounting, the framework and, uh, and understanding why some countries are so poor in the terms of a TFP. Why some are doing very well or much better than TFP and then try to find out underlying causes for that. I already mentioned a few things already last week. And this just now and then. Have a discussion on that. Why not you be in a coordinator? Yes, it is. Yes. No. Turn it around this group. Turn it around. Yeah.

SPEAKER 3
I don't disapprove for the you.

SPEAKER 1
You can just go out here. Very good. You don't have to be here. You don't have to be in a second line.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, I say OK, ok, very good.

SPEAKER 1
Very good. You found the seminar is ok. OK, very good. So how's everything? That's good, OK? Yeah. Travel a good one. I say. That's why we need I say that is why Yeah,

SPEAKER 3
yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
So in fact, you didn't expect so many important students, but anyway, so I think it's a good exercise. Yeah, Yeah, OK, Yeah. Feel free. Feel free to leave if you are busy, but yeah, OK, Ok. Good on you. Thanks.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, well, anyone, anyone, anyone.

SPEAKER 1
But you can focus on a particular angle. Other group, we focus on another one. So when we start exchange so we learn more, right? Yeah, it is Talk the same.

SPEAKER 3
They have some misunderstanding of what they are talking about.

SPEAKER 1
No, that's OK. Don't stop them. Just encourage to go. That's OK.

SPEAKER 3
The first Mhm.

SPEAKER 1
What's going on? So why? What's going on? You should see you. I see. Ok, OK, maybe a couple of minutes and then you start talking. Yeah, Yeah, this not ok.

SPEAKER 3
And I I and, uh, I right, I there's always this residue. Um What are what are the, uh I think it's an extra you only professor of the and the level A cert. There's no so a lot of so that S and I'll do that quick. Mhm As long as the what are the kind of like that for independent policies which first? Yeah, support. I was very busy. It's not gonna hear you guys. Could you speak louder? So, uh, what's our conclusion about the process? Uh, you say also your heart is no the the the importance of D and D Different places, different place. Uh, so you your house like it's a It's a measure. The cost effectively. So, like the less people it's OK. Ok. Oh, my God. So I'm asking here. OK, Yeah, but, uh, but you understand it That, uh,

SPEAKER 1
that framework, right. Once you have that framework set up, you can just apply. And, uh, capital is important. Capital accumulation. Labour force is also important. You know, you need the workers to work, But somehow, beyond that one, we need a productivity. So that's the the point that here. So, uh, I already mentioned that these days the productivity is so important. And, uh, when you look at the the table from the text so you can see that such differences in TFP that captured why some countries are so poor and they continue to be poor. Why some countries are doing better because they have some particular way of enhancing the productivity. Uh, just to summarise what are they and how we can through policies or whatever to improve the TF. The that's the right institution is actually in the electoral

SPEAKER 3
to the right because we know starting from here, that

SPEAKER 1
is. And this is all about the TFP. But it's far off. That's why I want to do study a bit further in advance. And other group is, uh, Well, unless you know, these things will become a difficult, right?

SPEAKER 3
And in the growth, we have to admit that it

SPEAKER 1
will be too early to discuss that one. But, uh, that's why I ask it, I give you some kind of a test, you have to do the homework and, uh, even you can just key in from Google about TFP. It's simple. So what are they? They can give you the answer. Example. Just a just a search TFP. I can give you all this, I think. But this one is the not the latest data, but it's useful technology the same.

SPEAKER 3
See how many? Uh, yeah, sure. Us Very right. And of course, why? Grand Children?

SPEAKER 1
So your purchases a textbook? That's very good. It's very handy. Yeah, very handy.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah. Um, you know, Yeah, all being captured there, but they

SPEAKER 1
due to so many factors, right, just identify a field one or two. That's it. That's right. Technology, innovation, entrepreneurship and institution building and capacity building. All of them innovation and all related and and then related. Those one to the policy and the institutional changes. That's it. That's the way. Yeah. And, uh, we don't ask you to actually to estimate the statistics. There but just understand the content. It's OK. It's sufficient. All right. And when people talk about the TAP, you have Oh, OK, I know the TAP. Right. Otherwise, you have no idea. Could you? Yeah. Just start talking. Very good opportunity.

SPEAKER 3
But some law. All right. The top of the world.

SPEAKER 1
OK? Yeah. Thanks.

SPEAKER 3
130. So one.

SPEAKER 1
OK, I want this group speak first.

SPEAKER 3
I should, uh that's still going on.

SPEAKER 1
Right? Let's give a couple of minutes. But others Others here can Others can hear they are sleeping. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good idea.

SPEAKER 3
You think? Beautiful council, right, Doctor? Let me know. Is there anything else things like that the need for so I can. And so yes, and by whatever your face. So the four to win they are the true.

SPEAKER 1
Let them let them. You can nominate them.

SPEAKER 3
I think it is so ok somewhere university and also in South Korea. I sorry you, um because the cold I feel mhm. I was developing Very and so when we went up has been pretty. Yeah, absolutely. So thank you so much. How to mhm. All right? Yes. And government.

SPEAKER 1
All right, I, I shall we? Yeah, OK, Very good. Yeah. So I like to have, uh, our online group to speak first. I think probably each group have just one or two, but, uh, other people just volunteering, right? You want to speak to this, too, But make your presentation. Uh, a short, uh I mean that the topic. Somehow we haven't really covered that one, but, uh, like I said last last week just to give it a try and, uh, to do some homework and to come up with some kind of an idea. So I can also see your, uh, your you know, your your level of understanding of those issue and the TFP. Perhaps too many students I noticed is actually unknown. Right? So you you haven't heard about the TFP so? But anyway, so this is a good beginning. Ok, le, let's give it a try. And, uh, so online group, please. Uh, have your representative or two to speak briefly about, uh, what you have been, uh, discussed. I just heard a brilliant discussion.

SPEAKER 3
Um, about the Botswana and the chia I would like to send. I think this is the one I would like to send a representative to give a presentation in front of us to summarise, uh, the comment of the discussion.

SPEAKER 1
You can nominate one. Yeah, it is. Oh, wow.

SPEAKER 4
Oh, my God. I'm on the screen. Um, hi, everyone. So, um, our group did, um, the different outcomes from using different strategies in Botswana and Nigeria. So, essentially, what we kind of talked about was Botswana and Nigeria were, um, both economies that were very resource rich, very well endowed. So Botswana had very, like a lot of diamonds, and Nigeria had a lot of oil. However, both countries ended up with sort of very different outcomes, with Botswana avoiding the resource curse and Nigeria suffering from the resource curse. And we largely sort of attributed this as a group to political instability in Nigeria. So we essentially touched on how, um there were a lot of clashes between military and civilian rule because, um, there was a lot of money coming in. Um, obviously from the oil, um which resulted in, you know, a lot of corruption, a lot of conflict, um, and ongoing instability. And it's kind of like a cycle that sort of trapped um, Nigeria. Um, and you know, As a consequence, there were a whole range of things which included Nigeria employing foreign labour. Um, and then obviously not being able to spend money on delivering efficient public goods. Um, whereas in Botswana, a lot of the money that came in was then spent on education. Um, and, um, resulted in very high skilled labour. Um, and things like that. And that's why Botswana, um, sort of avoided this cast. Um, whereas Nigeria suffered from it. So that was kind of the summary of our discussion. Thanks, guys.

SPEAKER 1
Thank you very much. And, uh, another, uh, representative, uh, from the online group. Uh, thank you very much. I'll make a comment shortly after everyone present it, OK? Yeah. Thank you so much. This actually see you very clearly. You're going to talk about the full screen. All right? Good on you.

SPEAKER 3
So let's start from this, though.

SPEAKER 1
Yes, OK.

SPEAKER 5
All right. So, like, we kind of went through the four questions. So, like, why TFP is crucial in enhancing economic growth in developing countries. So we kind of like agree that EFP is important as a tool to understand how poor countries can catch up in terms of output growth. And because most developing economies are agri or resource dependent and therefore labour intensive, the EFP will be relatively low. As your output labour output ratio will be high, that is, more labour will be employed to produce a given output. So, um, like us using the growth accounting framework, the analytical framework. So we kind of, um, discussed the EFP is that part of growth output growth that is not accounted by labour and capital? It's the residual So So what does it mean for you to be residual? So it's that part of output growth that cannot be explained by input growth alone. So it can be the it can be the output change with the passage of time, while holding the input quantities constant and as a third factor, it can also refer to the average rate of technological change between two periods. So what are those? Uh so So what can that be? So we kind of discussed that PFP can capture technological change, technological improvement over time as well as institutional changes. So we we sort of like jumped into the identifying the tools for implementing policies which are relevant in the context of development. So we we know that the FB can capture, potentially capture the institution and productive, um, technological improvement. So in the institutional factor, we can recognise that you need to strengthen rule of law property rights, and then you have to put enough con constraint and controls in place to prevent political abuse. So, like on the technological, um, improvement conditions. So we also agree that that means you have to improve or increase your investment in R and D in human capital. Infra those kind of things. So we're like saying you need It's kind of like cyclical in a sense that you need more investments. But then for you to have investments, you need to have higher savings. But for you to have higher savings, you need higher income. But then, for you to have higher income, you need to have higher productivity and wages and so on and so forth. So it's kind of like you know, for you to like, do your your your um, to do it right to be on the virtual cycle path instead of the vicious cycle path kind of interact as well with your institutional. How strong your institutions are so K and the empirical evidence in supporting the key argument, We kind of like discussed the case of Singapore, which improved its human capital in R and D investments. But it also has strong institutions. So like a a colleague as well, like mentioned about the the difference between North Korea and the South Korea growth path like both are similar in terms of national endowment and characteristics. But South Korea increased its TFP in terms of because it has strong institutions and likewise it also invested in human capital and infra. So yeah, that's very good.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, thank you so much. So our next group Yes, there is. Yes. Yeah, go ahead.

SPEAKER 6
Yeah, after we discussed about the TFP. So we have heard about the developing country. Are growth faster than developed country? But developing country can't reach the same level as the developed country. So that's from the solo model about the city state. So I think the TFP could enhance the productivity and we list out about some of an idea that we thought it might be a part of the TT FP. So we think about the R and D the same as the that group. So it's about the trait of an idea. So we think that developing country cannot build their own technology, so they need to import it from the developed country. And then they need to develop their education system to absorb that technology. And then when we, when developing country develop that next step is that human capital will be better. So we think that one that is the one of the factor that TFP could improve the ah, the the economic growth of developing country and also the immigration from the low income to the high income country and from the agricultural sector to manufacturing sector. I think that is that is another one of the TF pay that it can enhance the productivity at the end.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, that's excellent. Thank you. So can we have another representative? Yeah. Yeah, so very good.

SPEAKER 7
Yeah. Uh, So we we started off with AAA definitional discussion, I think for those of us that had studied economics previously, we we sort of remembered a term which was multi factor productivity. And, um, Wikipedia confirmed that multi factor productivity is the same thing as total factor productivity. So we were all talking about the same thing. We then we then spoke about how important the growth accounting framework might be for communicating the need for policy change to, uh to governments. Um, I in the sense that your your factors of production are relatively fixed in the short-term, particularly, uh, labour and sort of land inputs. Uh, and so total fat productivity is essentially the the sort of special source the the the efficiency with which your labour and capital inputs are are used in the production process to generate output and income. Uh, and then we spoke about what? What factors can can boost. Uh, TFP. And and there was a lot of discussion about education, uh, innovation, training, research and development incentives. Um uh, but also the importance of a strong institutions. So, you know, um, respect for property rights and, um, ensuring that, uh, resources and and other, uh, gains are not appropriated by the privileged classes.

SPEAKER 1
Very good. Excellent. And, uh, yeah, thank you so much. Any any others from the group Want to speak? Uh, no. OK, good eye. So let me move to, uh here, so Yes. Sorry. Let me pass you.

SPEAKER 7
Yes, yes.

SPEAKER 8
Hello, Hi. Uh, I also wrote special sauce in my notes. So So TFP relates to this special sauce that happens in the economy. It's beyond what's going on and in terms of capital or labour, um, we sort of talked about in the context of it's It's how the framework and the rules of an economy are set up. And it's the extent to which order is brought to that society and that helps improve the efficiency of whatever is going on. So the efficiency of labour, the efficiency of capital that's floating around, um, it introduces stability and sustain sustainability into the economy as well. Um, and it is something that so we talked about mostly in the context of, um, setting up strong institutions. That's pretty important. And they're not immune, though to so they need to also be innovative in their approach. So they need to be fixed. But also, they're open to technology and innovation developments. Um, so, yeah, I think that's already been said by everyone else. That's that's very good.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. Thanks. So, uh, maybe move down a bit? Yeah. For this group. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Be brief. Yes.

SPEAKER 9
Um, OK. Uh, since Everyone already talked about a lot of the, uh how the TFP is and how it works in different, uh, in the I mean, uh, in a more broader way. So I want to pick a particular country like Japan as an example, since it's a resource rare country, so it cannot rely on the resource to develop. And I want to mention that, uh, since, uh, uh 1868 the major restoration Japan start to develop their industry and, uh, mainly focus on the education. And, uh, it starts to build some rail and develop the transport and also the harbour to connect to the world. And, uh, so that a lot of new technologies that already developed by the UU by the UK or the US something, uh so come to Japan and, uh, they, uh, get a lot of foreign investment. And after that, Uh, since Japan has efficient labour and the inequality at that time in the country is not quite severe, so they have a lower labour wages and, uh, efficient labour workers. So they developed a lot of move from the agriculture to the industrial, industrial and service, and the institution is kind of important to see, I think, uh, the the policy supports the economic to go on. And, uh, uh, I think in the later 20th century, they add to the OECD, uh, OECD organisation and get a lot of financial help.
