Introduction
This chapter focuses on human capital formation in developing countries, and discusses the 
effects of education, the role of women, nutrition and health on the process of economic and 
social development. For a poor country to experience a faster pace of economic and social devel-
opment, it requires educated and literate people, an equitable participation of women and men 
in the labour force, and, above all, well-nourished, healthy people free from the debilitating dis-
eases that adversely affect the lives and productivity of so many people in poor countries.
Investment in human capital takes many different forms, including expenditure on formally 
organized education (both public and private expenditure), on-the-job and institutional training 
and retraining, study programmes and adult education, publicly funded nutrition programmes to 
keep people healthy and productive during their working lives, and expenditure on health facil­
ities for the prevention and treatment of illness.
First, we consider the participation in education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels, 
and expenditure on education as a proportion of total government expenditure and gross domes-
tic product (GDP). Primary school enrolment is virtually universal across regions of the world, but 
at the secondary level, enrolment is less than half the age group in low-income countries (particu-
larly in sub-Saharan Africa), and tertiary enrolment is less than 10% of the age group. The ratios 
of educational expenditure to total government expenditure and GDP are similar across regions, 
but per capita expenditure is much lower in low-income countries: only $100 compared to nearly 
$7,000 per head in high-income countries.
Second, we look at the rates of return to education and show that the private returns exceed 
10% for males and even higher for females (because the opportunity cost of education is lower). 
The highest returns come from investment in tertiary education. Third, we show the different 
ways in which the contribution of education to economic growth can be measured. With regard 
to the role of women in the development process, we highlight how women are disadvantaged 
as far as educational and employment opportunities are concerned, and the discrimination and 
burden they face in many developing countries.
Finally, we focus on nutrition and health, and highlight the link between poor nutrition and 
poor health. Evidence is provided on the benefits of improved nutrition in terms of improved 
productivity and reduction in the number of working days lost, and on how poor health hurts the 
functioning of economies. The three major ‘killer’ diseases in poor countries are malaria, tubercu-
losis and HIV/AIDS, and we discuss the various campaigns that exist to combat these and other 
diseases.
Education
The education of a population, male and female, from primary through secondary to tertiary 
education can overcome many of the characteristics of the labour force that act as impediments 
to social and economic progress, such as illiteracy, fear of change, unreceptiveness to new know­
ledge, a lack of incentive, and immobility. Improvements in the education and skills of labour can 
considerably increase the productivity and earnings of labour, and may be preconditions for the 
introduction of more sophisticated, advanced technology applied to production. The capacity 
to absorb and use physical capital may be limited by, among other things, investment in human 
capital. It is in this respect that there may be a close association between education and the main-
springs of technical progress.

Two main international bodies have recognized education as a basic human right: the UN’s 
Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 and UNESCO’s World Declaration on Education 
for All in 1990. Then, in 2000, representatives of the international community met at the World 
Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, under the auspices of UNESCO, and produced what is called 
the Dakar Framework for Action, comprising six goals to be achieved by 2015. The goals, and a 
brief assessment of each of these, are presented in Table 7.1. It can be seen from Table 7.1 that 
some progress has been made towards the goals set down, but still some poor countries have 
been unable to guarantee primary education to all school-age children, gender disparities still 
exist, and progress in adult literacy has been below target. The poor quality of education has 
effects on the well-being of children, their families and communities.
Table 7.2 shows clearly the underprovision of educational facilities and opportunities in 
many poor countries, and the low rate of literacy in the poorest countries. In low-income 
countries, the secondary school enrolment rate is less than 50%, and the tertiary enrolment 
rate is only 9%. The figures mirror the statistics for sub-Saharan African countries, which 
constitute the majority of low-income countries. Literacy rates are correspondingly low in 
low-income countries and Africa, barely reaching 50% for females. Note that for primary 
education, the enrolment ratio exceeds 100% in all regions. This is because the ratio is total 
enrolment, regardless of age, as a percentage of the population of the age group that corres­
ponds to that level of education. So, the primary school age group may be 5–11 years, but 
children older than that are attending. Also note that the enrolment rate is not the same as 
the completion rate, which is only 71% in low-income countries, and 69% in Africa. Moreover, 
enrolment and completion do not necessarily mean receiving a good education. For eco-
nomic development, it is not just the quantity of education that is important, but also its 
quality. Case example 7.1 provides a study of primary education in India, which highlights 
this fundamental difference.
Table 7.1  Education for All 2000–15: goals and their assessment
Goal
Assessment
Goal 1: Expanding and improving comprehensive early childhood 
care and education, especially for the most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged children
Progress in early childhood care and education was 
rapid but from a low base and highly inequitable
Goal 2: Access to and complete free primary education of good quality
Universal primary education was not reached in 2015
Goal 3: Equitable access to appropriate learning and life skills 
programmes
More adolescents received secondary education but 
measuring skill acquisition among youths and adults 
remains limited
Goal 4: Achieving a 50 per cent improvement in levels of adult 
literacy by 2015, especially for women, and equitable access to basic 
and continuing education for all adults
Progress in adult literacy was below the target
Goal 5: Eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary 
education by 2005, and achieving gender equality in education by 
2015, with a focus on girls’ full and equal access to and achievement 
in basic education of good quality
Many countries have not achieved gender parity and 
obstacles to equality remain
Goal 6: Improving all aspects of the quality of education and ensuring 
excellence of all so that recognized and measurable learning outcomes 
are achieved by all, especially in literacy, numeracy and essential life skills
There has been increased attention to issues of quality

During the period 2005–15, 350,000 new primary schools were built in India. Today, over 
95% of villages have a state primary school and enrolment is universal. A 2002 constitu-
tional amendment established primary education as a ‘fundamental right’ for every child 
aged 6–14. However, teaching and learning standards are very poor. Although the facilities 
have been provided, the quality of the teaching and learning process has been neglected. 
Over the past decade, 100 million children completed primary school but without at-
taining basic reading and maths skills. Many rural primary schools have just one or two 
teachers running mixed classrooms, with students of all ages and competency levels sitting 
together in a single room. Most teachers end up focusing on the students best able to keep 
pace, while the rest are left behind. Pupil and teacher absenteeism is very high. Children 
leave school during the harvest season, when they have to help their families. Whatever 
they have learnt, they forget. Attendance at government primary schools averages about 
70%, but it is less than 35% in many states. Also, high teacher absenteeism (15–25% of 
appointed teachers are absent on any given day) hinders the performance of pupils. State 
governments request teachers for large-scale tasks such as surveys and elections.
The difference between the targets and the results is a consequence of an ambitious 
national curriculum. It expects that students will read fluently by the end of the first 
year of school, without considering their limited exposure to books or written material. 
Teachers are expected to transfer vast quantities of factual information to students, 
regardless of their comprehension.
This situation in Indian education acts as a serious constraint on the performance 
of individuals and on Indian society. Most newly created jobs are in services, which 
require basic literacy and numeracy. Young people who lack these fundamental skills 
are likely to get jobs that don’t pay enough to raise them out of poverty.

Developing countries neglect educational provision at their peril. Research shows a strong 
association across countries between levels of human capital formation, growth performance and 
poverty reduction. For example, Baldacci et al. (2005) find, using a panel dataset of 120 develop-
ing countries over the period 1975–2000, that an increase in education spending of 1% of GDP is 
associated, on average, with three years of extra schooling and an increase in annual GDP growth 
of 1.5 percentage points after 15 years. This reduces the poverty head count by 17%.
Table 7.3 gives information on educational spending as a proportion of total government 
expenditure and GDP.
It can be seen that these ratios of educational expenditure in poor countries are not much 
different from rich countries, but because government expenditure and GDP are much lower 
in poor countries, the expenditure per capita is much less. In sub-Saharan Africa and South 
and West Asia, expenditure is particularly low, which is reflected in the very poor educational 
facilities for teaching and learning; large class sizes; lack of equipment; lack of books and other 
learning media; and often the poor quality of teachers. Moreover, it is clear from comparing fig-
ures between 1999 and 2012 that not much progress, if any, has been made in shifting resources 
towards education.
Estimating the rate of return to education
The main way of estimating the private rate of return to education is the method origin­
ally adopted by Mincer (1974), where the log of earnings (Ln wi) is regressed on the num-
ber of  years schooling (Si), controlling for the potential experience of an individual (Xi)

(estimated as agei –Si–6) and potential experience squared (Xi)2 (to allow for the diminishing 
returns to experience). Therefore:
Ln wi 5 a 1 b1 (Si) 1 b2 (Xi) 1 b3 (Xi)2 1 µi
(7.1)
where µi is a random disturbance term reflecting unobserved abilities and b1 is the average mon-
etary return to years of schooling.
This earnings function method can be used to estimate returns to different levels of schooling 
by converting the continuous years of schooling variable (Si) into a series of dummy variables, say 
DP, DS, DT, where DP is primary schooling, DS is secondary schooling, and DT is tertiary education, 
that is:
Ln wi 5 a 1 bP (DPi) 1 bS (DSi) 1 bT (DTi) 1 b2 (Xi) 1 b3 (Xi)2 1 µi
(7.2)
The returns to primary (rp), secondary (rs), and tertiary (rt) education are then:
rp 5 bp/Sp;  rs 5 (bs 2 bp) (SS 2 SP) and rt 5 (bT 2 bS) (ST 2SS)
where SP, SS and ST stand for the total number of years of schooling for each educational level.
The costs of education at different levels are the opportunity cost of not earning, tuition fees 
(if any), and expenses incurred in going to school.
The traditional consistent findings on rates of return to education when extra earnings and 
costs are considered are:
•
• private returns are positive, averaging 10% a year
•
• returns are higher in low- and middle-income countries than high-income countries
•
• returns are higher for primary schooling than for secondary education
•
• returns are higher for women than for men
•
• returns to education have declined slightly over time because, despite rising levels of average 
school attainment, the supply of schooling and educated people has responded to demand.
A new meta-study by Montenegro and Patrinos (2014) for the World Bank confirms all these con-
clusions, except that they find that the return to tertiary education is now the highest, and not 
the return to primary education. The new study uses data for 139 countries, with a total of 819 
harmonized household surveys over the period 1970–2013 (with 75% of estimates coming from 
the period 2000–13), covering 92% of world population.
The basic earnings functions in equations (7.1) and (7.2) are first applied to three different 
groups: the total sample, males, and females. The results are shown in Table 7.4. The average pri-
vate rate of return to another year of schooling is 10.1%. For males, the return is 9.6%, and for 
females it is higher at 11.7%. The returns are also estimated for levels of schooling, as shown in 
Table 7.4. The rate of return to primary education is 10.6%, while for secondary education it is 7.2% 
and for tertiary it is the highest at 15.2%. At all stages of education, the return for females is higher 
than for males because foregone earnings (opportunity costs) are less.
Montenegro and Patrinos also calculate rates of return to education across different regions of 
the world. Table 7.5 shows the results, and also the average years of schooling in different regions.
The returns do not differ much across regions, but are clearly highest in sub-Saharan Africa for 
both males and females. This is also true when the rates of return are estimated according to the 
level of education, shown in Table 7.6. The returns to primary, secondary and tertiary education in

Africa are higher than in many other regions. There is only one conclusion, which is that there is 
massive underinvestment in education in Africa – the poorest continent on the planet.
Finally, we can look at the rates of return to education over time. Since 1980, there has been 
a big expansion in school attainment. In the early 1980s, the average years of schooling was 
only 6.6 compared to 11.6 in 2011–13. As schooling increases, the return to schooling tends 
to decrease, as Table 7.7 shows. In the period 1980–85, the return was 13.3 and fell to 10.0 in 
2011–13. The returns have declined by 3.3 percentage points over a 30-year period; in other 
words, another year of schooling leads to a reduction in the returns to schooling by 0.1 percent-
age point.
The statistics and discussion above relate to the private return to education. The return to soci-
ety, or social return, also depends on the costs to government of providing schools and teachers,

and on the positive externalities to society that education provides. There are two main types of 
positive benefits or externalities that can be distinguished:
1.	 the effect of human capital on current productivity (static externalities)
2.	 the effect of learning and technological change (dynamic externalities).
The primary static human capital externality is that an individual’s human capital enhances the 
productivity of other factors of production, such as physical capital and the human capital of oth-
ers. The main dynamic externalities relate to learning by doing and the adoption of new technolo-
gies being more effective at higher levels of education. Whether the social return to investment in 
education is higher or lower than the private return depends on the balance between the costs to 
governments of providing educational facilities and the various static and dynamic externalities. 
Empirical evidence is scarce, but an early study by Pascharoupolos (1994) shows social returns to 
primary, secondary and tertiary education lower than private returns but still positive.
Likewise, Ram (1996) has fitted the Mincer equations (7.1 and 7.2) to pooled time-series and 
cross-section data for 45 countries using real GDP per worker (not earnings) as the dependent 
variable, so that the coefficient on the years of schooling per person variable measures the social 
returns to education rather than simply the private returns. Separate regressions are run for the

full sample of countries – developed, developing low-income and middle-income countries. The 
average rate of return is 13%, which is higher than the private returns estimated by Montenegro 
and Patrinos (2014). The highest social return is 16.2% in the middle-income countries.
Measuring the contribution of education to economic growth
There are three main ways in which education can improve growth performance:
1.	 Education improves the quality of labour, and also the quality of physical capital through the 
application of knowledge.
2.	 Education has spillover effects (externalities) on other sections of society, which offset dimin-
ishing returns to physical capital.
3.	 Education is one of the most important inputs into R&D and for attracting FDI.
There are three main methods of estimating the contribution of education to growth:
1.	 Measuring the contribution that education makes to the difference in earnings of individuals.
2.	 The production function approach.
3.	 The use of macrodeterminants of growth equations.
The first method involves constructing a quality-weighted index of the labour force, where quality 
is measured by the contribution that education makes to the difference in the earnings of indi-
viduals as a measure of productivity. The approach, pioneered by Denison (1962), involves two 
steps. The first entails gathering information on the distribution of the labour force by amounts 
of schooling at different dates. The second step involves collecting information on income differ-
ences between education cohorts with different amounts of schooling embodied in them, which 
are then used as weights to derive an index of the improvements in the quality of labour due to 
education, on the assumption that a certain percentage of differences in earnings is due to differ-
ences in the amount of education.
Suppose, for instance, that the earnings differential between those with eight years’ schooling 
and those with ten years’ schooling is 20%, that one-half of the difference is assumed to be due 
to the extra two years’ schooling, and that a person with eight years’ schooling is treated as one 
unit; then the person with ten years’ education counts as 1 1 (0.5 3 0.2) 5 1.1 units. The growth 
of the quality of labour due to education over a given period can then be estimated and its con-
tribution to measured growth calculated. For example, suppose that the growth in the quality of 
labour is estimated to be 1% per annum, the elasticity of output with respect to labour is 0.7, and 
the annual average growth rate of the economy is 3%. This gives a contribution of education to 
measured growth of 23%, that is, (0.7 3 1.0)/3.0 5 0.23.
The approach is not without its difficulties. The proportion of earnings differences assumed 
to be due to differences in the amounts of education between individuals is arbitrary, and if 
the figure is too high, this will give an upward bias to the contribution of education. On the 
other hand, there are other reasons why the approach underestimates the contribution of 
education:
•
• The methodology employed ignores the role of education in maintaining the average quality 
of the labour force.
•
• No allowance is made for improvements in the quality of education.
•
• There are the externalities or ‘spillovers’ from education to consider, such as the contribution of 
education to knowledge and its diffusion throughout society.

The second method for estimating the contribution of education to growth, and also the rate 
of return to educational expenditure, is to use the production function approach outlined in 
Chapter 4 (see equation (4.22)). All that is required is a measure of education expansion to include 
in the production function. The contribution of education to measured growth is then the rate of 
growth of the education variable multiplied by the elasticity of output with respect to the educa-
tion variable. In estimating form, the production function with the growth of education included 
is written as:
ry 5 rT 1 ark 1 brL 1 grE.
(7.3)
where rE is the rate of growth of education, and g is the elasticity of output with respect to edu-
cation. Suppose, for example, that the growth of educational expenditure (rE 5 ΔE/E) is 10% per 
annum and the elasticity of output with respect to education (g) is 0.01, then the contribution 
of education to measured growth would be (10)(0.01) 5 0.1 percentage point. If the average 
growth of GDP is 2% per annum, the contribution of education to economic growth would be 
0.1/2 5 5%.
The average social rate of return to education can also be measured independently using equa-
tion (7.3). Since g 5 (ΔY/Y)/(ΔE/E), we can write:
DY
DE 5 g Y
2
E .
(7.4)
where Y
– 
and E
–are the mean levels of output and the education variable, respectively. For example, 
suppose that the mean level of output over a period was £100 million, the mean level of expend­
iture on education was £5 million, and the elasticity of output with respect to education (g) was 
0.01. The rate of return would then be 0.2 or 20%, that is, (0.01)(100/5) 5 0.2 or 20%.
The third method for estimating the contribution of education to growth comes from new 
growth theory, discussed in Chapter 4, in which the stock of education (measured by enrolment 
rates, or number of years of schooling) is included as a variable to explain differences in growth 
rates between countries using large samples of countries. A simple cross-section estimating equa-
tion would be of the form:
g 5 a 1 b (PCY) 1 c (education). 
(7.5)
where g is the average growth rate of countries over, say, a 20-year period; PCY is the initial level 
of per capita income of countries, and (education) measures the proportion of the age group 
enrolled in primary or secondary schools in each country, or the average years of schooling. 
The coefficient, c, then measures the contribution of a 1 percentage point difference in school 
enrolment rates, or years of schooling, to the difference in growth rates between countries. 
Barro’s (1991) pioneer study using this approach, and adopted by others (see Table 4.5), sug-
gested that each additional year of schooling was associated with a 0.3 percentage point faster 
growth of per capita income over the period 1960–85. These so-called ‘macrodeterminants of 
growth’ studies also include a number of other variables, and the contribution of education 
to growth sometimes remains a significant variable and sometimes not. The fast growth of 
the East Asian economies in recent decades is often attributed to their heavy investment in 
education.
219
7  •  H u m a n  C a p i ta l
But highlighting the role of education in the growth process predates new growth theory. 
In the postwar years, it was Denison and T.W. Schultz (1961), in his presidential address to the 
American Economic Association in 1961, who first drew attention to the importance of educa-
tion for growth with quantitative evidence. According to Schultz, the stock of education in the 
USA rose by approximately 850% between 1900 and 1956 compared with an increase in repro-
ducible capital of 450%. He acknowledged the difficulties of estimating the rate of return to edu-
cation, but argued that even when every conceivable cost is considered, and all expenditure is 
treated as investment and none as consumption,1 the return on investment in education is at least 
as high as, if not higher than, the return on investment in non-human capital. Denison estimated 
a contribution of education to the growth of per capita income of 40%.
It is the apparent importance of education in the historical growth process of developed coun-
tries that has invoked the response that investment in human capital may be as important as 
investment in physical capital in developing countries. The empirical evidence seems to support 
this view. A World Bank (1980) survey concluded that ‘studies have shown that economic returns 
on investment in education seem, in most instances, to exceed returns on alternative kinds of 
investment, and that developing countries often have higher returns than the developed ones’. 
The figures presented in Tables 7.4–7.6 certainly suggest that investment in education yields a rate 
of return as high, if not higher, as investment in alternative assets. This is, of course, in addition to 
the intrinsic satisfaction to the individual of education itself.
The role of women in economic development
Women play a vital role in the development process as mothers, workers, entrepreneurs and 
agents for change; but in many poor developing countries, their role is not fully utilized and 
appreciated, and they face discrimination in many areas of life, such as in education, in the work-
force and in the ability to express their voice. Gender equality should be an integral part of the 
process of economic development. Gender equality can enhance the overall productivity of an 
economy, improve development outcomes for future generations, and make institutions more 
representative. Both men and women benefit when women’s welfare is improved. Women now 
account for 40% of the global labour force. However, the increased participation of women in 
the labour market has not been accompanied by equal employment opportunities or earnings 
with men. Women are more likely than men to engage in low-productivity activities, and, on 
average, women earn 10–30% less than men for the same work/responsibilities. There exists a 
serious gender pay gap. Likewise in the field of education, there are far fewer women in second-
ary and tertiary education, which is reflected in much lower literacy rates for females than men. 
Many factors explain the discrimination against women in poor countries, which differ from 
country to country, but the major factors would include: cultural traditions and the perception 
of women’s role in everyday life; gender differences in time use; unequal access to credit and 
assets; and institutional discrimination in the private and public sector (see Klugman et al., 2014; 
UN Women, 2015).
The World Bank’s (2012) World Development Report 2012 was devoted to the topic of gen-
der equality. The report is evidence-based, drawing on qualitative field research covering over 
4,000 men and women in 98 communities from nineteen developing countries, exploring how 
gender affects the everyday lives of women, as well as their aspirations, education, job choices, 
­
decision-making, and other aspects of welfare. The report argues that gender equality matters for 
220
F A C T O R S  I N  T H E  ­
D E V E L O P M E N T  P R O C E S S
two types of reasons. First, it matters intrinsically because it gives equal freedom to both women 
and men, and freedom is the ultimate goal of development (Sen, 1999). Second, it matters instru-
mentally because it contributes to economic efficiency and the achievement of other development 
goals. Three main channels are identified through which gender equality promotes development:
•
• A more efficient allocation of resources by reducing barriers to women accessing education and 
skills, thereby raising productivity.
•
• Improving women’s opportunities, human capital and voice has positive externalities for 
children by increasing investment in their health, nutrition and education.
•
• Improving women’s voice can improve the quality and effectiveness of institutions that benefit 
the economy and society as a whole. For example, where women have greater power, there is 
less corruption in public life. Giving power to women often increases the supply of public goods 
such as water supply and sanitation.
Some gender gaps have shrunk in recent years, but others have not. Most progress has been 
made in the following areas:
•
• Life expectancy is now as high for women as it is for men in all regions of the world.
•
• Fertility has declined dramatically (see Chapter 11).
•
• Primary school enrolment rates are equal for girls and boys.
•
• Participation of women in the labour force has increased.
But many gender gaps still persist and are rooted in deeply entrenched gender roles and social 
norms relating to who is responsible for the household, and what it is acceptable for girls and 
women to study. In general, the poorer the country, the greater the gender gap. Forms of hori-
zontal inequality such as ethnicity, race, religion and disability all adversely affect gender equality.
There are three main areas in which gender inequality still exists:
1.	 The mortality rate for girls and women is higher than for men. This gap is often referred to as 
the missing girls and women. Globally, it is estimated that 4 million females below the age of 
60 are ‘missing’: 40% are never born (because of the preference for males); 20% go missing in 
infancy and childhood; and 40% go ‘missing’ in the 15–59 age group because maternal mortal-
ity is much higher in poor countries than in rich.
2.	 There is a serious gender gap in earnings and asset ownership. Women are still concentrated 
in low-productivity activities where earnings are lower. In agriculture, women tend to operate 
smaller plots of land. In more dynamic sectors of the economy, there are fewer females in posi-
tions of responsibility and fewer entrepreneurs. Household duties still predominate for most 
women. Women have less access to credit because they lack collateral, and they possess far 
fewer assets. The IMF addresses this issue of women and work in its 2015 Annual Report (see 
Case example 7.2).
3.	 Women have much less agency or voice; that is, they are less represented in politics, law and 
the judiciary. They also suffer domestic violence.
Gender inequality tends to get reproduced over time. Attitudes are passed on from generation to 
generation, or change only slowly. If women as mothers do not work outside the home, the daugh-
ters are less likely to work. All institutions have inertia, where norms, customs and traditions prevail.
Now let us consider in more detail the current situation with regard to the education and 
health of women.
221
7  •  H u m a n  C a p i ta l
Women’s education
Women’s education brings a wide range of benefits not only for women themselves but also 
for their families and communities, and hence for society at large. There are many positive 
externalities to female education. More educated women tend to be healthier, participate 
more in the formal labour market, earn more income, have fewer children, and provide better 
education and healthcare for their offspring. The United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative, 
launched in 2000, was the first global partnership to specifically promote girls’ education and 
raise awareness of gender equality issues in education. Providing essential educational infra-
structure attracts girls to school. Building schools in underserved communities has helped 
overcome barriers to girls’ education. For example, a study in Ghor, Afghanistan, where vil-
lages were randomly selected to receive a primary school building, found that girls’ enrol-
ment increased by 17 percentage points more than boys, eliminating an existing gender gap 
(Burde and Linden, 2012). Target 4 of the MDGs laid down in 2000 was to eliminate gender 
disparities in primary and secondary education, and Table 7.8 gives the data for enrolment 
in 2013 compared to 1990. It can be seen that substantial progress has been made, although 
there is still some disparity between boys and girls in secondary school enrolment in sub-
Saharan Africa. Two of the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs: see Chapter 1), to be 
achieved by 2030, are ‘Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong 
learning opportunities for all’ (Goal 4) and ‘Achieve gender equality and empower all women 
and girls’ (Goal 5).
A crucial element of jobs and inclusive growth is the role of women in the workplace. 
Women make up more than half the world’s population, but their contributions to 
measured activity, growth and well-being fall short of potential. This has serious conse-
quences in terms of losses to an individual country’s GDP.
Despite significant progress in recent decades, labour markets across the world re-
main divided along gender lines and progress towards gender equality seems to have 
stalled. In a keynote speech in Tokyo in September 2014 on ‘The Economic Power of 
Women’s Empowerment’, Christine Lagarde, IMF managing director, described the 
barriers working women face worldwide: ‘When women do participate, they tend to 
be stuck in low-paying, low-status jobs. Globally, women earn only three-quarters as 
much as men – this is true even with the same level of education and in the same 
­
occupation.’
Building on the Working Paper ‘Can Women Save Japan?’ (Steinberg and Nakane, 
2012), analysis on women and work has expanded rapidly. Area departments of the 
IMF have put in place pilot assessments of the issues related to working women in 
the context of Article IV consultations across a range of countries, with the goal 
of building expertise, facilitating collaborations with other institutions and sharing 
knowledge.

Women’s health
Women’s health is best analysed according to their age group. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) refers to four main age groups and their main causes of ill health and the fatal conse-
quences of deaths:
1.	 Infancy and childhood (0–9 years): The main causes of deaths are birth asphyxia, infections 
and diarrhoea. Nearly half of deaths in children aged under five is attributed to malnutrition.
2.	 Adolescent girls (10–19 years): This group suffers from depressive disorders, the leading cause of 
ill health. Globally, adolescent girls and young women are twice as likely to be at risk of HIV infec-
tion compared to young men in the same age group. Pregnant adolescents are more likely than 
adults to have unsafe abortions, leading to lasting health problems and maternal deaths. Alcohol 
and tobacco use endangers young women’s health in later life. In half of the countries with avail-
able data, over a third of girls aged 16–19 years are anaemic. Girls and women are most vulnerable 
to anaemia due to insufficient iron in their diets, menstrual blood loss and growth spurts.
3.	 Reproductive age (15–44 years) and adult women (20–59 years): Depression is the lead-
ing cause of ill health for women. Depression following childbirth affects 20% of mothers in 
low- and lower middle-income countries. Women who have been physically or sexually abused 
have higher rates of mental ill health, unintended pregnancies, abortions and miscarriages than 
non-abused women. For women aged 15–44, HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death world-
wide (see below). Maternal deaths are the second biggest killer of women of reproductive age. 
Tuberculosis is among the five leading causes of death. Cervical cancer is the second most com-
mon type of cancer in women. Due to poor access to screening and treatment services, more 
than 90% of deaths occur in women living in low- and middle-income countries. One-third of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in women is caused by exposure to indoor smoke from 
cooking with open fires or inefficient stoves.
4.	 Older women (60 years and over): This group is affected by cardiovascular diseases and cancers 
and, to a lesser extent, by chronic respiratory conditions. It is important to highlight that much of

the poor health faced by women in older age is the result of exposure to risk factors in adolescence 
and adulthood, such as smoking, sedentary lifestyles and unbalanced diets. Older women experi-
ence more disability than men, reflecting broader factors contributing to poor health through 
their lifetime, such as the unequal treatment of women in the household and the workplace.
The state of women’s health in poor countries is most clearly reflected in the maternal mortal-
ity rates across the world. Table 7.9 gives the maternal mortality ratios measured as the number of 
deaths due to pregnancy-related causes per 100,000 live births. It can be seen that the mortality 
rate is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by the least developed countries (which includes 
many African countries) and South Asia. In countries such as Afghanistan, Chad, Guinea-Bissau, 
Liberia, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone and Somalia, at least 1 out of every 25 women die from com-
plications relating to pregnancy and childbirth. A larger fraction of women also suffer adverse 
long-term health consequences from giving birth. Target 6 of the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs; see Chapter 1) was to ‘reduce by three-quarters between 1990 and 2015, the maternal 
mortality ratio’. The goal was not met. A number of measures can still be taken to improve the 
situation, including new maternity clinics, training more maternal health nurses and providing 
poor women with cash transfers conditional on seeking pre- and postnatal care. Transport facil­
ities also need improving to facilitate the process of getting pregnant women to hospital.
Mothers’ Index
State of the World’s Mothers (Save the Children, 2015) shows that one of the worst places to be a 
mother is in an urban slum. Poverty, and the social exclusion that goes with it, leaves the urban 
poor trapped in overcrowded, makeshift or decrepit housing. Pregnancies occur too early in 
life and too often. Save the Children, a charitable organization, publishes a Mothers’ Index, 
which assesses the well-being of mothers and children. Five indicators are taken into account 
to construct the index:
•
• maternal health – lifetime risk of maternal death
•
• children’s well-being – under-five mortality rate
•
• educational status – expected number of years of formal schooling
•
• economic status – GDP per capita
•
• political status – participation of women in national government.

In 2015, 179 countries were ranked. The top, middle and bottom ten countries are given in Table 7.10. 
The Nordic countries of Norway, Finland, Iceland, Denmark and Sweden come top, where mothers 
and children attain very high scores in health, educational, economic and political status.
By contrast, the condition of mothers and children in the bottom ranked countries (all in 
Africa except Haiti) is grim. On average, 1 woman in 30 dies from pregnancy-related causes, 
and one child in eight dies before their fifth birthday. There are, however, interesting anomalies. 
Rwanda, for example, is the top country for political status, with the highest proportion of women 
in parliament (57.5%), yet it ranks only 121 when the other four indicators are taken into account.
Another measure of the gender gap is the Gender Inequality Index, published by the UNDP 
(United Nations Development Programme), which considers three indicators: maternal mortality 
ratio (deaths per 100,000 live births); adolescent birth rate (births per 1,000 women aged 15–19); 
and share of seats in parliament held by women. The top, middle and bottom ten are shown in 
Table 7.11, out of a total of 151 countries. Again, all the countries in the bottom ten are African.

Policies to reduce gender gap
Let us now turn to policies that could be implemented to help reduce the gender gap. The World 
Development Report 2012 (World Bank, 2012) argues for increasing women’s individual and collect­
ive agency, that is, the ability of women to make choices and transform them into desired actions 
and outcomes. Empowering women as political and social actors can change policy choices and 
make institutions more representative. The report identifies five priority areas:
1.	 Reducing maternal mortality and closing education gaps where they remain.
2.	 Improving economic opportunities for women.
3.	 Closing earnings and productivity gaps between men and women.
4.	 Increasing women’s voice and agency in the household and in society.
5.	 Limiting the transmission of gender inequality across generations.
Reducing maternal mortality requires not only more clinics and trained nurses, but also health-
related policies, such as the provision of clean water at the point of use and sanitation, waste dis-
posal and drainage; in other words, a cleaner, safer environment in which to live and raise a family. 
Closing the education gap requires getting girls into school and staying there. Conditional cash 
transfers can help. Evidence from a range of countries shows that increasing the share of house-
hold income controlled by women through cash transfers or their own earnings change spending 
in ways that benefit children. Policies that discourage child marriage and school-related, gender-
based violence also need to be strengthened.
In terms of improving access to economic opportunities for women, and closing the earn-
ings gap, female farmers and entrepreneurs have less access to land and credit than their male 
counterparts. It is necessary to improve the functioning of credit markets, in the way that some 
microcredit schemes have helped women to access small-scale credits and build up a track 
record of borrower performance (e.g. the Grameen Bank, see Chapter 13). Differences in access to 
opportun­
ities for women also partly arise from differences in time available because women have 
responsibility for the care of children and housework. Anything that saves time for women will 
improve their economic opportunities.
Increasing women’s voice and agency in the household and society requires a change in atti-
tude towards women, and removing discriminatory laws and regulations. In over 120 developing 
countries, the law treats men and women differently, making it impossible, for example, for a 
woman to obtain independently an identity card or to own property and have access to credit. 
Control of fertility is also important, which requires family planning services to suit women.
Finally, limiting the transmission of gender inequality across generations must be addressed, 
and tackled early in life before ideas and norms of behaviour are moulded. The culture and educa-
tion in households and schools must shift towards empowering women. Everyday tasks such as 
carrying water or caring can be redistributed within the family to give more time to women.
All these reforms and changes are more likely to succeed if there is broad-based support, par-
ticularly support from men. This is where the challenge lies. Discrimination against women is a 
waste of human capital.
Nutrition
For individuals to achieve their full potential and lead healthy and productive lives, they need the 
right nutrition from birth. The sad fact is, however, that millions of people in the poorest develop-
ing countries are malnourished and may have been from birth. This has serious consequences for 
226
F A C T O R S  I N  T H E  ­
D E V E L O P M E N T  P R O C E S S
the individual and for society at large, which has to cope with the health consequences of mal-
nourishment and proneness to disease. It has been estimated by the UN’s Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), which is based in Rome, that over 3 billion people worldwide suffer from 
various types of malnutrition, including over half the world’s 1.5 billion children. One billion peo-
ple suffer protein-energy malnutrition, 1.3 billion suffer from anaemia (iron deficiency), 1 billion 
people have iodine deficiency, and 30 million children have vitamin A deficiency, causing blind-
ness and death. Nearly 1 billion people have no reliable access to safe drinking water, and nearly 
 
2 billion people have no access to proper toilet facilities, including half the population of India 
(Drèze and Sen, 2013). Nearly half the population of poor countries suffer from water-related dis-
eases. Diarrhoea caused by unclean water claims the lives of 1.5 million children a year. This weakens 
the body, and the weaker and more undernourished children are, the more prone they are to infec-
tion and disease; and the more infections, the greater the undernourishment due to loss of appe-
tite, the difficulties of eating and the low absorption rate of food during digestion. Malnutrition 
among children is particularly serious because it stunts growth and mental development, and adds 
another twist to the vicious circle of poverty. Malnutrition is also a major cause of infant mortality, 
the rate of which is almost ten times higher in developing countries than in developed countries.
In his monumental, path-breaking book An Inquiry into Well-Being and Destitution (1993), 
well-known Indian economist Partha Dasgupta attempts to understand the common circum-
stances in which people are born in poor countries and in which they live and die in rural com-
munities in these countries. He pays a lot of attention to the question of nutrition and its effects 
on health and work effort. The relation between low income and food intake is, of course, a 
two-way one. Low income is the major cause of malnutrition, which, in turn, is a cause of low 
income as it impairs work efficiency and productivity. Indices or measures of malnutrition can be 
based either on nutritional requirements, in terms of different kinds of food, or on food energy. 
Both affect labour productivity. The food requirements that nutritionists consider necessary for 
efficient working and healthy living are far greater than the levels achieved by the vast mass of the 
population living in developing countries. Calorie deficiency causes loss of body weight, tiredness, 
listlessness and a deterioration of mental faculties. Calories are also required for the absorption of 
protein: if the calorie requirement is met, the protein requirement is normally met too, but not 
always. Kwashiorkor – a condition associated with the bloated stomachs and staring eyes of the 
starving or malnourished children we often see on our television screens – arises from protein 
deficiency because the calorie intake is in the form of low-protein tubers such as cassavas and 
yams. Protein is particularly important for brain development in the first three years of life, dur-
ing which time the brain grows to 90% of its full size. Maternal nutrition is crucial for the health 
of babies. Once babies are born, the damage that malnutrition does in the first 1,000 days of life 
is irreversible. According to research published in the Lancet (Utzinger and Tanner, 2013), mal-
nourished children are less likely to go to school, less likely to remain at school, and more likely 
to struggle academically. The consequences go beyond school performance. They earn less than 
their well-nourished peers over their lifetime, marry poorer spouses and die earlier. Malnutrition 
is responsible for the deaths of some 3 million children a year (te Lintelo and Nisbett, 2015).
Of the 40 nutrients people need, four are in chronically short supply: iron, zinc, iodine and 
vitamin A. Lack of vitamin A causes half a million children to go blind every year. Zinc deficiency 
impairs brain and motor function and causes some 400,000 deaths a year. Shortage of iron weak-
ens the immune system and can badly affect women of childbearing age. Iodine deficiency causes 
goitre and mental retardation.
When it comes to the relation between nutrition and the capacity for physical effort, nutri-
tion is generally defined in terms of the energy requirement. In this context, Dasgupta (1993) 
227
7  •  H u m a n  C a p i ta l
defines undernourishment as ‘a state in which the physical functioning of a person is impaired 
to the point where she cannot maintain an adequate level of performance at physical work, or at 
resisting or recovering from the effects of any of a … variety of diseases’. The minimum amount of 
energy or maintenance requirement (r) is the daily calorie requirement when a person is engaged 
in the minimal activities of eating and maintaining essential hygiene, with no allowance for work 
and play. According to nutritionists, r is 1.4 times the basal metabolic rate. The relation between 
productivity and energy intake is shown in Figure 7.1.
The interesting thing in Figure 7.1 is that the slope of the line is decreasing, but it could be 
linear or even increasing over certain ranges. When Bliss and Stern (1978) surveyed the litera-
ture, they found the line to be linear in the region slightly to the right of r. More recent research 
confirms this (see Behrman, 1993, for a comprehensive survey) and shows substantial economic 
and social returns to investment in nutrition and health, in terms of increased productivity 
on the job, increased productivity of time spent in school, and cost savings from treating the 
consequences of malnutrition and poor health. The costs of treating various forms of malnutri-
tion are trivial relative to the tangible benefits and the costs of treating the consequences. To 
prevent malnutrition in children from the age of six months to three years, which is a child’s 
most vulnerable period, can cost as little as $100 at current prices. The annual cost of prevent-
ing malnutrition is no more than the daily cost of treating its effects. Vitamin A deficiency is 
a cause of blindness. The annual cost of supporting a blind person is at least 1,000 times the 
annual ingredient cost of the vitamin A needed for prevention. Iodine deficiency is a cause of 
hypothyroidism (goitre), which leads to cretinism and deaf-mutism. The cost of iodized salt to 
prevent this is less than $0.02 per person per year. And so one could go on. Prevention is better 
than cure not only for the individual but also in a very real economic sense for the welfare of 
society as a whole.
The FAO is the major international organization concerned with ensuring food and nutrition 
security for the people of the world. Case example 7.3 gives its mission statement.

The member states of the WHO have endorsed a comprehensive implementation plan on 
maternal, infant and young child nutrition, which includes six global nutrition targets to be 
achieved by 2025 (WHO, 2014a). The six targets are:
1.	 Stunting: 40% reduction in the number of children under-five who are stunted. Childhood 
stunting is one of the most significant impediments to human development, globally affecting 
approximately 162 million children under the age of five. Estimates indicate that stunting can 
reduce a country’s GDP by up to 3% a year (see Case example 7.4).
2.	 Anaemia: 50% reduction of anaemia in women of reproductive age. Anaemia affects half a 
billion women of reproductive age worldwide. The highest prevalence of anaemia is in Asia 
and Central and West Africa. Improvements have been seen around the world; for example, 
Burundi (64.4% down to 28% in 20 years), Nepal (65% down to 34% in 8 years) and Nicaragua 
(36.3% down to 16% in 10 years).
3.	 Low birth weight: 30% reduction in low birth weight. It is estimated that 15–20% of all births 
worldwide have low birth weight. Affordable, accessible and appropriate healthcare is critical 
for preventing and treating low birth weight.
4.	 Childhood overweight: No increase in childhood overweight. The prevalence of childhood 
overweight is increasing in all regions of the world, particularly in Africa and Asia. It is predicted 
that the prevalence of overweight children under 5 years old will rise to 11% worldwide by 
2025, up from 7% in 2012.
5.	 Breastfeeding: Increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months up to at least 
50%. Exclusive breastfeeding has the single largest potential impact on reducing child mortal-
ity of any preventive intervention. Globally, only 38% of infants aged 0–6 months are exclu-
sively breastfed. Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Malawi have all seen dramatic increases in rates of 
exclusive breastfeeding.
6.	 Wasting: Reduce and maintain childhood wasting to less than 5%. Wasting is a reduction of 
body weight in relation to height. It is estimated that 52 million children under 5 years old 
are wasted, with 17 million of those estimated to be severely wasted. The majority of wasted 
children live in Asia. India accounts for approximately one-half of the global burden of wasting.
There are links between the global nutrition targets. For example, stunting is linked with anaemia 
in women of reproductive age, low birth weight, childhood overweight, not enough exclusive 
breastfeeding and wasting.
Case example 7.3
Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) mission statement – continued
malnutrition. It ensures that agricultural development is people-centred and leads to 
improve availability, access to and consumption of safe and diverse foods for better 
nutrition. To improve nutrition, the FAO:
•
• Facilitates high-level dialogue between sectors and nations seeking a common agenda 
on nutrition, agriculture, sustainable food systems and healthy diets.
•
• Helps countries to devise policies and run programmes that will improve nutrition.
•
• Shares knowledge to help implement food-based nutrition policies through nutri-
tion education and consumer awareness.
•
• Reviews evidence, offers guidance and scientific advice on all aspects of nutrition.

Nutrition offers one of the best returns on investment. It has been estimated that every US$1 
invested in nutrition generates US$138 in better health and increased productivity. Conversely, 
not investing in nutrition perpetuates economic losses, at an estimated cost of up to 11% of 
annual GDP in lost production. On average, governments and donors spend 1–2% of their budgets 
 
on nutrition. They need to double the resources devoted to improve nutrition if global nutrition 
targets are to be met by 2025 (IFPRI, 2015).
Case example 7.4
Childhood stunting
Stunting is an enormous drain on economic productivity and growth. Economists es-
timate that it can reduce a country’s GDP by up to 3% a year. Among many other 
international organizations, the WHO has been making efforts to ameliorate the prob-
lems related to malnutrition. In 2012, the WHO’s Assembly endorsed a comprehen-
sive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition, which stated 
six global nutrition targets for 2025. The first target is to reduce by 40% the number 
of stunted children under 5 years. Childhood stunting is one of the most significant 
impediments to human development. It has long-term effects on people, including: 
diminished cognitive and physical development; poor health and reduced productive 
capacity, and an increased risk of degenerative diseases such as diabetes. Currently, it 
affects about 162 million children under the age of 5 years, and the target is to decrease 
it to 100 million by 2025.
There is a suggested framework for action to achieve the stunting target, which 
focuses on tackling the causes of stunting. It focuses on the 1,000-day window from a 
woman’s pregnancy to her child’s second birthday. Policy-makers should consider the 
following actions:
•
• improve the identification, measurement and understanding of stunting and 
scale up coverage of stunting-prevention activities;
•
• enact policies and/or strengthen interventions to improve maternal nutrition 
and health, beginning with adolescent girls;
•
• implement interventions for improved exclusive breastfeeding and comple-
mentary feeding practices;
•
• strengthen community-based interventions, including improved water, sani-
tation and hygiene (WASH).
Bolivia, Brazil, India and Peru are examples of countries that have implemented 
successful multisectoral approaches to effectively address stunting; for example, edu-
cation policies that keep girls at school throughout adolescence; laws curtailing the 
marketing of breast milk substitutes; labour laws that provide maternity protection in 
support of exclusive and continued breastfeeding; and agriculture and food policies 
designed to improve household food security.

Some countries have made significant progress in reducing the incidence of malnutrition: 
examples are Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Vietnam, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. 
These countries have made progress by creating a political environment conducive to nutrition-
improving action, investing in high-impact, cost-effective nutrition intervention, and adopting 
policies in a wide range of economic and social sectors.

D E V E L O P M E N T  P R O C E S S
Political commitment to reducing malnutrition is so important that the Institute of 
Development Studies at the University of Sussex now produces a Hunger and Nutrition 
Commitment Index (HANCI), which ranks governments on their political commitment to 
tackling hunger and malnutrition. The HANCI compares 45 developing countries for their per-
formance on 22 indicators relating to three areas of action: legal framework, policies and pro-
grammes, and public expenditure. In 2014, Peru topped the index followed by Guatemala. Sudan, 
Angola and Guinea-Bissau were at the bottom of the ranking (te Lintelo and Lakshman, 2015).
The MDG Target 1c of halving the share of the chronically undernourished of the world’s 
popu­
lation by the end of 2015 was almost met. Goal 2 of the new SDGs is to ‘end hunger, achieve 
food security and improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture’, with the aim of 
 
ending malnutrition by 2030. Interestingly, out of the 17 goals, with 169 targets between them, 
this is the only one that mentions nutrition, with no reference to obesity at all. To downplay the 
role of nutrition is a mistake.
Water
Water is a basic ‘nutrient’, essential for human existence. Access to clean water at the point of use 
should be considered as a basic human right, yet three-quarters of a billion people are denied 
it. Fresh water is extremely important for health. The biggest single cause of child deaths is diar-
rhoea and other waterborne diseases. Acknowledging the importance of access to clean water 
for health and sanitation, one of the UN’s MDGs was to halve by 2015 the proportion of people 
without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. In 2012, 748 million people 
remained without access to safe drinking water. Dirty water and poor sanitation kill over 500,000 
children a year.
Women bear the brunt of providing fresh water for their families in many of the poorest coun-
tries of the world. In sub-Saharan Africa, only half of households are within 15 minutes of a water 
source. Women and girls are the primary water carriers for their families. Where rural water sources 
are distant, women may walk up to two hours a day to collect it. Where urban water is obtained 
from shared standpipes, they may wait in line for over an hour. Case studies from around the world 
show that water-related ‘time poverty’ translates into lost income for women and lost schooling for 
girls. Constantly fetching and carrying water in heavy containers also has severe health implications. 
In extreme cases, curved spines and pelvic deformities can result, causing problems in childbirth.
Singapore has been recognized as the best country in the world to manage its water. Little 
water is wasted. Used water is treated and then safely disposed of, reused for industrial purposes 
or air-conditioning, or mixed with reservoir water for drinking. Recycled waste and desalinated 
water are expected to meet 25–30% of demand. There are lessons to be learned from Singapore.
In Africa, the eThekwini and Sharm El-Sheikh Declarations in 2008 committed countries to 
spending 0.5% of GDP on sanitation and hygiene, but this has gone almost universally un­
observed. 
Countries have a responsibility to provide fresh water for their citizens with the help of the 
 
international community.
Water Aid is a leading international charity committed to improve access to safe water, sanita-
tion and hygiene for the poorest and most marginalized people and operates in 26 poor countries. 
In 2013–14, Water Aid provided 2 million people with safe water: 71% in rural areas, 21% in urban 
areas and 8% in small towns.
Water is not evenly distributed. Nine countries account for 60% of all available supplies, and 
among them only Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Congo, Indonesia and Russia have an abundance of 
231
7  •  H u m a n  C a p i ta l
it. China and India, with over a third of the world’s population between them, have less than 10% 
of the world’s water. Africa has 35 of the 45 most ‘water-stressed’ countries.
Water is not only required for human survival but also for many activities, including farming, 
cattle breeding, manufacturing goods, and as a means of transport, among many others. Fresh 
water management represents a huge challenge, mainly due to its increasing demand by a growing 
world population and changes in the climate. Of all the activities that need water, agriculture uses 
almost 70% of the world’s supply, while industry takes about 22%, and domestic activities account 
for 8%. There are options to overcome the growing demand for clean water. Desalination is one 
possibility. Although it is still an expensive alternative, there are various techniques and technolo-
gies available. The prospect is that solar power will make desalination economic in the future.
Health
Human survival depends not only on nutrition but also freedom from infection and disease. This 
brings us to the topic of the health of people in poor countries, the various diseases that poor 
people suffer from, and the effect that poor health has on the economies of developing countries 
in terms of work days lost through illness and low productivity.
Angus Deaton, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, argues in his masterly book, The Great 
Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality (2013), that improvement in the health of 
humans is the most important measure of economic and social progress and that although man-
kind has experienced an improvement in health through time, many people have missed out – 
notably the poor. There is a vicious circle between poverty and ill health. Poverty leads to illness 
because of poor nutrition, lack of sanitation and clean water. Poor health then leads to poverty by 
reducing an individual’s productivity and by the potential reduction of assets used to cover the 
cost of treatment. For Deaton, health is one of the most important components of well-being, and 
he believes that inequalities in health (between rich and poor countries and rich and poor people) 
are ‘one of the greatest injustices in the world today’. He takes a moral stance when he says: ‘those 
of us who are fortunate enough to have been born in the “right countries” have a moral obligation 
to help reduce poverty and ill health in the world’. Here, we are going to discuss the various dis-
eases that are prevalent in poor countries, and which still kill millions of children and adults, and 
the international campaigns that exist to combat them. We shall also consider the research that 
attempts to measure the effect of ill health on the economic performance of countries.

Killer diseases
There are three main killer diseases in poor countries that affect their development potential –
malaria, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS. These diseases are preventable, and the first two are 
curable. In 2013, together they killed over 3.5 million people. Their symptoms while people are 
alive include high temperature, weight loss, muscle pain and fatigue, all of which affect the qual-
ity of life and the ability to work productively. Goal 6 of the MDGs was to reverse and then halt 
the spread of malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS. At the international level, there is a Global Fund to 
Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.2 This is a private foundation, which raises, manages and 
disburses private and public funding to support countries in their fight against the three dis-
eases. The Global Fund is complemented by disease-specific targets set by UNAIDS, the WHO, 
the Stop TB Partnership and the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership. The Global Fund spent 
$8 billion between 2002 and 2013, and it is estimated that total eradication of these diseases by 
2040 will cost $100 billion – but the total economic benefit would be $2 trillion, which is a very 
high ­
benefit–cost ratio. Each disease has been assigned a day to raise international awareness: 25 
April for malaria, 24 March for TB and 1 December for HIV/AIDS. Table 7.12 provides a summary 
of the number of people newly infected with malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS, deaths, and progress in 
prevention.
SDG 3 continues from MDG 6 and aims to ‘ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all 
at all ages’. Specifically, it aims to end the epidemics of malaria, TB and AIDS, and other contagious 
diseases, by 2030.
Malaria
Malaria is a preventable and treatable infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes, which kills 
more than half a million people a year, most of them (90%) in sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria 
is the leading cause of death for children under five. The key interventions to prevent malaria – 
insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), insecticide spraying, and access to treatments – are well known, but 
eliminating the disease requires a broader range of actions. Efforts to improve housing and infra-
structure development, sanitation, agricultural practices, mobility, and nutrition are also needed.
Malaria transmission continues to affect 97 countries and territories worldwide, inflicting a 
tremendous burden on countries. Nearly 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa still lack access 
to a protective ITN, and at least 15 million pregnant women do not receive the protective treat-
ment they need to keep themselves and their unborn child safe. The Democratic Republic of

the Congo and Nigeria account for over 40% of global deaths from malaria. In Southeast Asia, 
the second most affected region of the world, India has the highest malaria burden, followed by 
Indonesia and Myanmar.
Malaria takes a high toll on households and healthcare systems, and impedes economic devel-
opment in endemic countries. A cross-country regression analysis for a 25-year period (1965–90) 
estimated annual rates of economic growth to be 1.3% lower in countries with a serious malaria 
burden than in countries with less malaria (Gallup and Sachs, 2001). Malaria also discourages for-
eign investment, increases people’s out-of-pocket spending on healthcare, and impairs children’s 
ability to learn for those who survive the illness.
The Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership was launched in 1998 by WHO, UNICEF, UNDP and 
the World Bank in an effort to provide a coordinated global response to the disease. The RBM 
and UNDP convened a Consultation on Developing a Multisectoral Approach to Malaria in July 
2013. Participants agreed on the development of an action framework and a roadmap to iden-
tify ways forward for better addressing the socio-environmental determinants of malaria and to 
engage agencies from non-health sectors. The Multisectoral Action Framework for Malaria was 
launched alongside the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2013 
(RBM and UNDP, 2013). The year 2015 marked a turning point in the treatment of malaria. A global 
framework Action and Investment to Defeat Malaria (2016–30) organized by RBM placed the 
management of the disease as a development issue. It complements the WHO’s Global Technical 
Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030. Today, malaria can be diagnosed, treated and prevented with a 
combination of available tools. However, global estimates indicate that US$4.2 billion is needed 
each year to fully fund the fight against malaria. There is hope for the future. Scientists working on 
the global genome project have unlocked the genetic code of the malaria parasite and the mos-
quito species that transmits it. This paves the way for a new generation of vaccines, insecticides 
and repellents to combat malaria – provided, of course, that it is profitable for drug companies 
to develop them.
Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis (TB), like malaria, is also preventable and curable. TB is transmitted by air, through 
coughing and sneezing. Persons with weak immune systems, such as those living with HIV, malnu-
trition or diabetes, or people who smoke tobacco, have a much higher risk of getting infected. TB 
remains a leading cause of death among people living with HIV, accounting for one in five AIDS-
related deaths globally. Over 95% of cases and deaths are in developing countries. Brazil, Russia, 
India, China and South Africa account for almost 50% of global TB cases.3 In 2013, there were an 
estimated 9 million new TB cases and 1.5 million TB deaths (including 400,000 people with HIV). 
Although most TB cases and deaths occur among men, the burden of the disease among women 
and children is also high. In 2013, there were an estimated 3.3 million cases and 510,000 TB deaths 
among women, and 550,000 cases and 80,000 deaths among children. Although the TB mortal-
ity rate has decreased by 45% since 1990, it is still regarded as serious, given that most deaths are 
preventable if people can access healthcare for diagnosis and treatment.
Access to TB care has expanded substantially since 2000. Between 2000 and 2013, 37 million 
lives were saved through effective diagnosis and treatment. However, there remains a huge gap 
in services. Of the nearly 9 million people who developed TB in 2012, 3 million of them were 
not diagnosed and thus not treated. Diagnosis can be difficult, particularly in cases of multi­
drug resistant forms of the disease. Treatment is also difficult; standard TB involves six months of 
daily medication, whereas multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB requires up to two years of treatment. 
234
F A C T O R S  I N  T H E  ­
D E V E L O P M E N T  P R O C E S S
The cost per patient treated for drug-susceptible TB in 2013 was in the range US$100–500. The 
cost per patient treated for MDR TB ranged from an average of US$9,235 in low-income countries 
to US$48,553 in upper middle-income countries. Many TB-endemic countries cannot afford to 
treat their patients; their national healthcare systems are overburdened with the disease, and the 
infrastructure necessary for TB treatment is extremely costly. The World Bank estimates that, for 
some countries, the loss of output attributable to TB is 4–7% of their GDP.
The Millennium Development Goal to reverse the tuberculosis epidemic by 2015 was achieved 
globally. In 2013, the TB mortality rate had fallen by 45% compared to 1990. The WHO has devel-
oped a post-2015 global TB strategy – The End TB Strategy. Its goal is to end the global TB epi-
demic by 2035, with corresponding global targets for a 95% reduction in the number of TB deaths 
and a 90% reduction in the number of cases compared with the baseline of 2015 (see Table 7.13).
HIV/AIDS
In 2014, 1.2 million people died from Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-related causes. 
Although there is no cure for HIV, there are effective treatments that can control the virus so that 
infected people can still lead healthy and productive lives. The most advanced stage of HIV is 
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV/AIDS has destroyed families, communities 
and affected the economy of entire nations. As Kofi Annan, former secretary-general of the UN, 
said when addressing the International AIDS Conference in July 2004 in Bangkok, Thailand: ‘AIDS is 
far more than a health crisis. It is a threat to development itself.’ Since 2000, when the outlook was 
dire, the AIDS epidemic has been taken seriously. The Millennium Development Goal 6 played 
a crucial role in targeting the epidemic. In 2015, the world achieved the AIDS targets of MDG 
6 – halting and reversing the spread of HIV – according to a comprehensive report published by 
the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2015). In 2000, fewer than 700,000 
people were receiving antiretroviral medicines; in 2015, 15 million accessed them. Over the same 
period, new HIV infections declined by 35%. Table 7.14 summarizes three aspects of HIV/AIDS – 
people living with HIV, new HIV infections, and AIDS-related deaths, for seven regions in 2014.
New HIV infections declined steadily between 2000 and 2014. The number of newly infected 
people in 2014 was 35% lower than in 2000. Likewise, since 2004, when the number of AIDS deaths 
peaked, the annual number of AIDS-related deaths declined by 42% (see Figure 7.2). In 2014, an 
estimated 1.2 million people died of AIDS-related causes globally. However, the number of people 
living with HIV continues to increase. This is because more people have access to antiretroviral treat-
ment and as a result are living longer, and there is still a high number of new HIV infections each year.
The most significant gains in reversing the epidemic have been among children under the age 
of 15. Since 2000, new HIV infections among children have declined by 58%; however, still in 2014, 
2.6 million children were living with HIV (see Table 7.14 for a regional breakdown). The epidemic

among children stems from HIV transmission during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. In 
2015, Cuba became the first country to be certified by the WHO as having eliminated new HIV 
infections among children and ending mother-to-child transmission.
Although 70% of people living with HIV live in only 17 countries, the HIV epidemic remains 
global, affecting virtually every country in the world and adding substantially to health burdens. 
Sub-Saharan Africa has been the most affected region, with 25.8 million people living with HIV. In 
2014, South Africa alone accounted for 18% of all the people living with HIV in the world; followed 
by Nigeria (9%), Zimbabwe (4%), Mozambique (4%), Tanzania (4%), Uganda (4%) and Kenya (4%).

When countries are ranked by the incidence of HIV (ratio of people living with HIV to the coun-
try’s population), in 2014, the following sub-Saharan countries came top: Botswana (18%), South 
Africa (13%), Zimbabwe (11%), Zambia (8%), Malawi (7%), Mozambique (6%), Uganda (4%), 
Kenya and Tanzania (3%), and Ivory Coast and Nigeria (2%).
The global response to HIV is estimated to have averted 30 million new HIV infections and 
nearly 8 million AIDS-related deaths since 2000, when the MDGs were set. Everyone living with 
HIV needs access to HIV treatment: this is the promise that world leaders committed to in 2015 
with the Sustainable Development Goal to end the epidemic by 2030. Two success stories against 
AIDS are highlighted in Case example 7.5.
Senegal
In 2014, Senegal registered 2,400 AIDS-related deaths and 44,000 people living with 
HIV. It has made major efforts in the past five years to scale up access to HIV preven-
tion, treatment, care and support services for its population, with a focus on key, higher 
risk groups. It is one of the few countries in the western and central African region that 
has collected robust data on hard-to-reach populations, such as sex workers, men who 
have sex with men and people who use drugs. The country has scaled up access to 
antiretroviral therapy, and treatment is now widely available in many parts of Senegal. 
The number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy increased from 5,500 in 2006 
to nearly 18,000 in 2011. The combination of efforts is having positive results. Accord-
ing to UNAIDS, HIV prevalence among the general population remains stable at 0.7%, 
while HIV prevalence among sex workers has decreased from 19.8% in 2006 to 18.5% in 
2011, and new HIV infections among youth have decreased. The Global Fund highlights 
Senegal as a model for the response to HIV in the western and central African region.
Rwanda
AIDS-related deaths of all ages in Rwanda have decreased significantly since a peak in 
2002–03, when there were 21,000 deaths, compared to 3,000 in 2014. The number of 
people living with HIV has fallen moderately from 270,000 in 1999 to 210,000 in 2014. 
The government of Rwanda continues to scale up HIV services: by the end of 2013, 493 
out of 495 health facilities in the country provided testing and counselling services, 488 
provided services to prevent mother-to-child transmission, and 465 provided antiret-
roviral therapy. TB-related deaths among people living with HIV declined by approxi-
mately 45% between 2000 and 2010, accompanied by a 70% decline in child mortality 
and a 60% decline in maternal mortality. This achievement provides a sound example 
of the way that the benefits of investment in AIDS prevention and other chronic dis-
eases can extend far beyond the treatment of AIDS itself. Rwanda is piloting an innova-
tive financing mechanism in partnership with the Global Fund, where grant funds will 
be used to implement Rwanda’s National Strategic Plan for HIV (2013–18) and TB/HIV.

Two success stories against AIDS: Senegal and Rwanda
Other diseases and health expenditure
Apart from the big killers of tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS, there are many other tropical diseases 
that continue to disable tens of millions of people in tropical Asia, Africa and Latin America, 
such as leprosy, river blindness, Chagas disease and lymphatic filariasis. With modern medicine 
237
7  •  H u m a n  C a p i ta l
and antibiotics, there is now the opportunity to eliminate these diseases. The global registered 
prevalence of leprosy at the beginning of 2013 stood at 189,018 cases. During 2014, 22 countries 
reported that more than 112 million people were treated with ivermectin to treat river blindness 
(onchocerciasis), which is transmitted to humans through bites of infected blackflies. Infected 
people live in 31 sub-Saharan Africa countries and in some particular places in Latin America and 
Yemen. Chagas disease is spread by bloodsucking bugs and infects 6 to 7 million people worldwide, 
mostly in Latin America. Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as ‘elephantiasis’, is a neglected 
tropical disease, and 1.1 billion people in 55 countries remain threatened by the disease and require 
preventive chemotherapy to stop the spread of this infection. In addition, there are waterborne 
diseases, which include cholera, dysentery, typhoid and worm infection. There are about 1.7 billion 
cases of diarrhoeal disease every year. It kills around 760,000 children a year under the age of five 
(for all diseases, see WHO, Global Health Observatory data, www.who.int/gho/database/en).
Table 7.15 presents some health-related statistics for 2013, including total expenditure on health 
as a percentage of GDP, health expenditure per head of the population, life expectancy at birth, and 
the infant mortality rate. Notice the colossal difference in health expenditure per capita in rich and 
poor countries. While in high-income countries, expenditure is $4,456, in the low-income countries 
it is only $37. The low expenditure and lack of access to basic health facilities in poor countries is 
reflected in the much lower life expectancy of only 61 years in low-income countries (and 58 years 
in Africa) compared to 79 years in high-income countries. There is also a big difference in infant 
mortality rates, with 53 deaths per 1,000 live births in low-income countries compared with only 6 
deaths in high-income countries. Baldacci et al. (2005) calculate that an increase in health expend­
iture of 1% of GDP is associated with an increase of 0.5 percentage points in the survival rate of 
children under 5 and a 0.5 percentage point increase in per capita income growth.

The provision of education, nutrition, health services, water supply, housing and sanitation 
came to be known in development circles in the 1970s (and supported by the World Bank) as 
the basic needs approach to economic development. The rationale of the approach was that the 
direct provision of such goods and services was likely to relieve absolute poverty more immedi-
ately than alternative strategies, which would simply attempt to accelerate growth or rely on rais-
ing the incomes and productivity of the poor. Five arguments were used to support this change 
in strategy:
1.	 Growth strategies usually fail to benefit those intended.
2.	 The productivity and incomes of the poor depend in the first place on the direct provision of 
health and education facilities.
3.	 It may take a long time to increase the incomes of the poor so that they can afford basic needs.
4.	 The poor tend not to spend their income wisely, and certain facilities such as water supply and 
sanitation can only be provided publicly.
5.	 It is difficult to help all the poor in a uniform way in the absence of the provision of basic needs.
The basic needs approach has lost none of its rationale in the direct fight against poverty and 
disease in the world’s poorest countries.
The impact of ill health on growth and development
There are several channels through which better health may impact on the economic growth and 
development of countries:
•
• Healthier people are more productive. They can work harder, longer and they can think more 
clearly.
•
• Health improves educational outcomes through better attendance at school and improved 
cognitive functioning.
•
• Lower mortality and higher life expectancy encourage savings for retirement and release re-
sources for investment.
Cole and Neumayer (2006) have conducted a major study of the impact of poor health on total 
factor productivity growth (TFP), taking a panel of 52 developed and developing countries over the 
period 1965–95. They estimate TFP from a standard neoclassical production function (see equa-
tion 4.22) and then relate differences between countries to malnutrition, malaria and waterborne 
diseases. Malnutrition impacts on productivity by sapping the energy of workers and making them 
more susceptible to infection and disease. Malnutrition used as a causal variable in the analysis is 
measured by the percentage of the population undernourished. Malaria similarly makes workers 
feel weak, and impairs cognitive ability. Malaria is measured by an index, which combines the per-
centage of land area affected and the percentage number of malaria cases. Waterborne diseases 
are a great health risk in poor countries and include dysentery, cholera and typhoid fever. This also 
impacts on energy at work, and on school attendance. This is measured for empirical analysis by 
the percentage of the population without access to safe water. The function estimated is therefore:
TFP 5 a 1 b1 (incidence of malnutrition) 1 b2 (incidence of malaria) 1  
b3 (lack of access to safe water) 1 e
(7.6)
where the coefficients b1, b2 and b3 measure the effect of these three health variables on the 
growth of TFP across countries, and e is an error term. The results are significant and striking. The 
239
7  •  H u m a n  C a p i ta l
coefficients on all the health variables are negative. Malnutrition reduces TFP growth by 0.17 per-
centage points (p.p.), malaria by 0.58 p.p. and lack of access to safe water by 0.1 p.p.
Another way of estimating the effect of poor health on the macroeconomic performance of 
countries is to calculate the number of working days lost through ill health. This is the preferred 
approach of the World Health Organization (WHO, 2008), which calculates what they call disabil-
ity-adjusted life years (DALYs), which adds up the number of years lost as a result of poor health 
or disability, and is measured as the difference between an individual’s current health status and 
an ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and 
disability.4
Table 7.16 gives the 20 leading causes of work years lost through ill health. Heart disease 
(which is not infectious) comes top, but malaria, TB, HIV/AIDS and waterborne disease also figure 
prominently. Once total DALYs have been calculated for each country, they can be included in a 
cross-country growth regression of the form:
y 5 a 1 b1 (DALY) 1 b2X 1 e
(7.7)

where y is the growth of per capita income and X is a vector of control variables. The coefficient 
b1 measures the impact of days lost through ill health on the growth of living standards. Murray 
and Lopez (1996) estimate the per capita disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost in various 
regions of the world in 1990 due to premature mortality and years lived with disability adjusted 
for severity. The estimated impact on per capita income is lower in developed countries at about 
0.17 p.p. The impact ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 p.p. in various regions of the developing world, and 
reaches close to 0.6 p.p. in sub-Saharan Africa. Specific disease variables can also be included in 
equation (7.7). Malaria, for example, has a strong negative effect of 0.36 p.p. (similar to that found 
by Gallup and Sachs, 2001).
Summary
•
• The economic and social development of poor countries requires educated and liter-
ate people; an equitable participation of men and women in the labour force; and well-
nourished, healthy people free from the debilitating diseases that affect work effort and 
­
productivity.
•
• Investment in human capital takes the form of expenditure on formal education; on-the-job 
and institutional training; study programmes and adult education; nutrition programmes; and 
expenditure on health facilities.
•
• There is serious underprovision of education facilities and opportunities in many poor coun-
tries – particularly with regard to secondary and tertiary education. Literacy rates are low.
•
• Private rates of return to education are high in poor countries, averaging 10%.
•
• Investment in education can add substantially to the growth performance of countries.
•
• There is serious discrimination against women in developing countries. Gender equality in edu-
cation, employment opportunities, voice in society, and access to credit should be an integral 
part of the development process.
•
• Women’s health has been neglected in poor countries and needs urgent attention.
•
• For individuals to achieve their potential and lead healthy and productive lives, they need the 
right nutrition from birth – but millions remain malnourished throughout their lives.
•
• The WHO has a comprehensive plan to tackle maternal, infant and young children malnutri-
tion, targeting child stunting; anaemia; low birth weight; child overweight; breast feeding; and 
wasting.
•
• Good health requires clean water, but three-quarters of a billion people lack access.
•
• There is a vicious circle between poverty and ill health. Ill health means incapacity to work ef-
fectively, and low productivity means poverty.
•
• The three killer diseases in poor countries are malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS, plus various water-
borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery.
•
• There are many international campaigns, such as the Global Fund, to eradicate malaria, TB 
and Aids –and their eradication is one of the Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved 
by 2030.
•
• Health expenditure in poor countries is rudimentary, and needs to be given greater 
­
priority.
•
• Ill health has an adverse effect on the growth of total factor productivity of countries and the 
growth of per capita income when individual diseases are considered or total working days lost 
through ill health (DALYs).

Notes
1.	 The greater the proportion of expenditure treated as consumption, the higher the rate of return on 
the investment component.
2.	 The Global Fund relies on voluntary financial contributions from all sectors of society – govern-
ments, private sector, social enterprises, philanthropic foundations and individuals. The Bill & 
Melinda Gates Foundation has been a key partner of the Global Fund, providing cash contributions, 
active participation on its board and committees, and substantial funding to related advocacy and 
fundraising efforts. To date, the foundation has contributed or pledged a total of US$1.4 billion to 
the Global Fund.
3.	 The WHO classifies 22 countries as high TB burden countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, 
Cambodia, China, D.R. Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nigeria, 
Pakistan, Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, Tanzania, Vietnam and Zimbabwe.
4.	 DALYs for a particular disease or health condition are calculated as the sum of the years of life lost 
(YLL), which corresponds to the number of deaths multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the 
age at which death occurs. So, YLL 5 N 3 L, where N is the number of deaths and L is the standard 
life expectation at age of death in years.
