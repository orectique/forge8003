SPEAKER 1
No. Let me give you the summary about, uh, the course content. This, uh, as you know, the, uh uh uh the, uh, foreign assistance The topic involving, uh, some kind of a conceptual or theory. Right? And, uh, which are providing those kind of framework in which we can under which we can, uh, do the analysis. And, uh, why countries, uh, you know, especially developing country need foreign aid or foreign assistance. And to put it in a simple way, we can see that, uh, for foreign borrowing allows a country to what basically do two things right from the lecture number one to import more than a country export, right? If you don't have this foreign borrowing, you know, the the the trade balance is not the balance of the current car, so therefore it allows you to import more than you export. The second one is that it allows a country to invest more. Then it saves, right. So therefore, you know, these are two gap, basically two Gap model. One Gap model is the foreign exchange. When you have a foreign exchange gap, you can see this actually constrain your growth. And, uh, there's a few slides of doing that one. But on the other hand, you also have a saving investment gap in a domestic setting, right, saving If it's not sufficient in providing investment. You know, borrowing can fit in that gap. So that is a rather simple. But at the same time, it's also illustrate the, uh, the importance of, uh, of course, the importance of a foreign borrowing but also raising an issue about, uh, what sort of a condition are there in order to utilising the foreign borrowing more efficiently or more effectively. So that's related to the old debate about whether foreign assistance or foreign aid are appropriate or effective or not. So again, the lecture highlighting two set of views, right? One set of view was saying that no and, uh, not necessary because, given, you know, decades of a of a programme in borrowing and lending to developing country, a lot of developing countries, the performance didn't improve at all, and in some cases, actually make it worse. So in that case, perhaps, uh, you know, again, debate is a lot of, uh, study. Also showed that the aid programme actually can be effective. Can be effective. Under what condition? And that the condition, of course. If you, you know, read, uh, the lecture notes, Uh, listen to the lecture. Uh, you know, uh, uh, carefully. You can also say that it's actually it depends on a few few things. Right. And you can name it, you know, good policy, right? And good governors and a good institution And all these, uh, you know, including the policies, uh, in infrastructure, human capital. So all these things are some kind of a condition for recipient country to actually accept the foreign aid more effectively, but in terms of the analysis we have, we can see there's a kind of a formula there as well to see what sort of a condition when you're utilising the foreign capital, the capital in the form of a foreign aid but also the capital in terms of, uh, FDR the foreign direct investment. So what's the what's What is the condition for that one? Basically, to put a simple way without really looking at the formula is that you have to have a system that the system allow the country to utilising foreign capital more efficiently. So this is the, uh this is the key, uh, variables in the, uh in the formula. You know, there's a one slide looks complicated, but actually it is not. If you look at the last one, the last one give us a, you know, very important in the bracket. One difference. The difference between what? Between the sigma, which is the the productivity of capital and also the gamma gamma is what gamma is the interest rate on which you borrow. So that means the capital return or the productivity of capital you borrow using the capital. If it is a higher, then the interest rate under which you borrow that's very fine. Why, because according to the formula, the foreign borrowing of the debt level increase will be positively contributing to economic growth. This is as simple as that. That means the funding ways of improve the, uh the the utilisation of the or the efficiency of capital utilising capital. That's the That's the key. And for those countries who have borrowed a lot but failed right and didn't turn into the borrowing into a very productive forces and the part of that one is again very simple is because they don't have this kind of a system. Right? Good policy, Good governors, You know, for those, uh, the governors are especially relating to people actually manage manage those products or managing FD I or borrowing. Right? And uh, in fact, if in fact, there's a many country, uh in Africa, for example, those programmes are badly run. In fact, there's a lot of corruption right relating to foreign programme, so that, as you can see, will be very inconsistent with the criteria. Right. So we will just H outline outline is because of those criteria are also very important. So again, I think you can also apply the, uh, the hero doma model. In the lecture, we mentioned that one as well, right? Haro doma model is the is the one who identify those one. But we have a little bit of twist about the Haro DOMA model. The traditional Har DOMA model is a gross link to the saving as well as the capital of ratio. Right? But if you can turn the capital of ratio in the just reverse that one you can see that is actually reflecting. What we just said is the productivity of capital. So the same thing. Saving and the productivity of capital. So that's the kind, you know, highlighting those kind of the growth in the in that context. So that's one side of the analysis. I think there's also the debate in the lecture talking about the the structure, right kind of a lending. And but there's a pros and cons. Structural kind of landing is actually basically to address those countries where they have a lack of the the capabilities lack of a good governor, lack of a good policy, lack of a people or the personnel we actually can run capable of running the programme. So there was a structural landing, uh, is especially designed by the, uh you know, international agencies, basically to to target that way to enhance countries capability and uh, and for those countries. But there's some successful story, but in a lot of cases, actually it's not that successful. The reason Perhaps we can discuss in lecture 11 later on. The reason is that there was a structural lending programme somehow designed based on the the so called Washington consensus. Meaning what the donors imposing very stringent condition for the recipient to receive those of our aid. And and you know, for many developing countries, it's very difficult for them to fulfil to fulfil those conditions as a precondition for receiving foreign aid programme. So therefore you can see the some kind of an incompatible arrangement are happening. So that's why it's a developing country also criticising You know, those donors in a way. And, uh, that's the debate relating, uh, about, uh whether it's relevant to, uh, apply there the Washington consensus, right? Or or not. So, uh, in fact, in many cases actually failed. And so that's the debate. It's not about the Washington consensus itself, as you know, when we release not today, but, you know, lecture 11 maybe is all the key elements in the Washington consensus. You know, such as the marketization, such as the ownership reform such as the physical discipline. And, uh So all these things are actually quite relevant in a way. But however, when you are put in a package as a kind of, uh, you know, a precondition So, uh, those countries are very difficult to fulfil are very difficult to fulfil those, uh, those requirements. So therefore, you know the project, uh, you know, destined to to fail. And so that's another, uh, uh, set of, uh uh, analysis. And, uh, I think the, uh, the the lecture also covered the issue about the foreign direct investment and the multinational companies. And this is not a This is not the lecture, actually, to give a kind of a due attention to those topic because the topic can be very independent. In fact, in pogo programme uh, Professor Chun Chen, he actually offered this, uh, specific course on FD I and apart from the WTO issues, So, uh, so we just lightly touch upon that one as a part of, uh, you know, receiving the foreign capital, uh, into the recipient countries. And, uh, I think after that the lecture talk about, uh what we call the optimal borrowing. This is also interesting concept, right? And by how much you can see that the borrowing is too much or is too little too little We know because the gap is there, right? In order to fill in the gap. We know, you know, development kind of need to borrow if you don't borrow and then you have this foreign exchange gap, for example, and then that can actually imposing as a kind of a constraint on economic growth. So therefore, relaxing that constraint by borrowing is actually the way to go. But however, do we have an in theory? Or maybe in the empirical sense, do we have AAA optimal level of a borrowing? So, uh, in the in the lecture, if I I'm sure if you listen to that one, you can notice it. There is a chat that the chart shows this. This is very, very easy to show the growth but link to the, uh, the level of borrowing and being captured by a ratio of, uh, foreign borrowing over the total export. That's one of the criteria in measuring, You know, those are the degree of, uh, or the extent of borrowing. So, uh, can anyone remember what is the the optimal ratio, which can lead to the, uh, the best outcome in terms of a contribution to economic growth? What is the level of a debt over export? A country's export? Yes. So it it's 80 right? It's 80. That means that if you have an 80% of that ratio, actually, this is actually kind of a real data to show that the debt the borrowing can contribute to the growth is at the at the highest level. And then if country continue to borrow beyond 80 you can see 90 until probably over 100 and in many cases is much higher than that one. You can see the contribution to growth can be close to zero or can be negative. That is the That's the indication to show that they borrow too much, right. That is also the indication, perhaps also explain So many countries are running into the so called debt crisis right too much, and that this is related to, uh, you know, debt crisis discussion, and, uh, that itself can have a whole lecture, you know, talking about, uh, the debt debt, debt crisis happened in 1982 started from Mexico and again spreading to many other countries. And, uh, you can also talking about this. This is the lecture 11. When we talk about the balance of payments constraint, growth, we can also talk about East Asian financial crisis, in which countries like Thailand, you know, uh, Malaysia, Indonesia. All all countries affected very badly, right? So the key lessons that can be learned and through that one. But that is the lecture 11. So those are those debt, you know, the reason for causing the debt crisis can be digest, but more or less, you can see it traces back to the theory we outlined before. Yes, the foreign, uh, developing country need a borrowing because there's the two gaps, right. But again, you know, we just highlight there is some kind of an extent by which you know the borrowing can occur, which actually can deliver some good outcome. But in many countries, case is sort of sufficient but debt crisis actually have a unique background or the historical background. So one slides. I think if I remember correctly that the debt crisis actually is what is being the so called exchange exchange exchange rate right issue. And so you can go beyond the what lecture? Uh, you know, uh, uh, required. But just going deeper in analysing why, you know, borrowing can, uh can you know, In theory, it can be a positively contributing to growth, but in practise, there's so many constraints, right? And those constraints can lead towards some kind of the crisis and the Yeah, there's so many, uh, many, uh, courses for that one. So we do identify finally, the lecture also highlighting There's very this is actually really that part is very much related to what we're going to discuss in seminars. And this is the definition is called the, uh H I PC country H I PC is the the so called highly indebted poor country. So that's our special categories and these categories of countries and, uh, now facing enormous problem right now, especially after covid right in the post covid period. You can see that, uh, that relief debt restructuring and it can be very relevant for those countries. So there's several criteria and how they apply certain policies right in helping those countries to overcome the difficulty. So I won't extend that one because we are going to talk about this one in the in the seminars. And so any questions about the lectures, especially any students in the group are writing the topic on foreign aid? Yes. So we do have yes. So in that case, perhaps you can go much deeper in analysing and go through the lecture nodes first, and perhaps also try to develop those framework as we introduce, but also very useful for you to organise some kind of a data or empirical. Right? Either is a specific country, but also can be a comparison of a different countries, right? And for those who have a very successful programme of receiving foreign aid as compared with those countries who actually failed and the conditions, a lot of things is already being introduced so you can refer to There's also a lot of publication. And, uh, Professor Steven house from his teaching the the 8000. And, uh, again, I think the foreign age is also be part of that, uh, the, uh uh uh course content. And, uh, Anyway, there's a lot of references and the discussion about the country specific, so you can use that materials, right? In a way to, uh, to strengthen your your analysis. So that's the other summary, and I miss a lot, but, uh, I think, but, uh, I think I kind of covered the main main issues there. And also, that lecture can be reviewed in a way in connection with the with the previous lecture, right? And the financing development and from domestic sources. And to say, this is basically talking about the foreign, right? And so basically in meeting the same thing about the financing development anyway, no questions. Yes, it is in this like this.

SPEAKER 2
The reason why countries giving aid for that If it's way too much, why is it still allowed by daughters? Like, why did you realise this problem is getting great, but good texture, um, depth or the eight that is even is way too much. Why do you not understand? Keep keep being right? Why, you very good question. Because, uh, very good. If the FA is not effective for some reason, why

SPEAKER 1
did a coming right?

SPEAKER 2
This is a good question. Why is this?

SPEAKER 1
Good question is that, uh, because the, uh, this actually arrangement this a certain has to know. For develop countries, there's a certain requirement about a certain

SPEAKER 2
percentage of their GDP will be used for R a or RC.

SPEAKER 1
And uh, what is the current region now? Something like one 0.7 at all. And in some it's very dark.

SPEAKER 2
They have a 2% or either above two as a as a foreign aid.

SPEAKER 1
So that means this is the obligation of the commitment by the government in developed countries in providing as a foreign aid right, That's one side of things. Keep going. That's, uh, the money is available. So so, uh, another one is that is the bilateral and also international agencies, right? They also have this kind of rather imposing foreign aid programme. So the party is there. So even though some kind of countries are all the programme are not running efficiently, effectively, but the money keep coming. So that's why the even in the bilateral, I'll give you one example and when the Indonesia there's a big earthquake right many years ago and, uh, all the donors came to the place to help, and, uh, each donor will have a list of all the requirement about the recipient right people, the ordinary people about their programme and during the crisis. And, uh, this is a big earthquake and then so many donors. So the local people have to deal with the donors all the time instead of fighting, you know, to deal with the crisis. And, uh so the the When the report is being released, people will say Wow, you know, lack of a coordinating in a way. Everyone want to help and the money is available. But however you know, from a receiving point of view, you know, you got to have this kind of a coordinations. In a way, I agree and the better, you know, to keep this more effective in a way, or we try to find a way of improving those foreign aid. But that's the situation. And bilaterally, it's also the country have obligation. The part is always available in foreign aid and foreign assistance and the and the targeting a specific country so that basically they made that is available. It doesn't matter how efficiently, effectively utilise it. So that's a good question. That's highlighting part of the lecture to improve, right? So those kind of a structure lending that's the one thing to address the so called supply side issue and the capability right institution governors and good policy, but importantly, the people, the human capital, right? And, uh, and especially those people working in government, right? So when they are becoming more capable of running the programme, you can see that can lead to the most, uh, good out. Yeah, a good outcome. Good question. Yeah. Any other question? Yes. Phil. Just want to ask something about this.

SPEAKER 2
I feel like so important. More advice about So let's say, because the relation to Haiti, you know, the Haiti, uh, government government, they they they ra the entire country. Really? For a while, when there's an earthquake, like, say, say, Hey, I'm not, um besides Gillette. No republic.

SPEAKER 3
So it's about even though the government's regulation is really poor in Haiti. But when there's not earthquake, the international society still have to donate some to to to rescue to to to to rescue the people there to have some, um, uh to have some assistance or or whatever financial or physical. Um, I feel like this is this is about political correctness. It's not only about how efficient the the the the developing country has to use the foreign aid. But it's not like like like what? You said commitment like a guarantee that there should be existed regardless of the similar questions.

SPEAKER 1
But I will say that if there's no aid in time of crisis, country and the people affected will be will be suffering tremendously. So even though some programme, especially during the crisis right, are effective in a way. But without them, you can imagine you can imagine the situation. So anyway, that is the is the same. You know, the set of problem about the, you know, is a kind of a constant routine, the foreign aid and all the foreign assistance in time of crisis. Basically, you are talking about in terms of crisis, right? And, uh, there may be kind of a coordinating will be needed, but in the way that if you if you don't have this kind of a foreign assistance, that will be terrible for people who who suffer right from that crisis anyway.

SPEAKER 2
Yes, in case I'm just like curious in case of countries where it is, um in case of countries where

SPEAKER 4
it is tainted by, for example, like terrorism or rebel group like in Afghanistan. To some extent, we still need to give aid to the people, right. But at the same time, if you keep giving aid, you also to some extent empowering more the rebel group or the aid or or the armed group like what do you think is the best way to balance that?

SPEAKER 1
That means if the country, the domestic governor system is not efficient or good governor system and and and the foreign aid keep powering that basically entrenched, you know, those people in power, right? But that situation is very difficult to overcome, very difficult to overcome. And, uh, now, for example, if you require that the system very systematic change. So we we we we mentioned just now about the Washington consensus right for those reform measures and as a precondition for receiving foreign aid. There is no age we're coming because there's no way for those countries to fulfil those kind of conditions in a way. So I think the donor, from their point of view, or even for the the interest of the country of the people to continue to, you know, to provide those of foreign aid, but at the same time to see that the gradual change to gradual change the way of, uh, of managing foreign aid, for example. But also perhaps also, uh, you know, better still, for those, uh, gradual institutional changes in those countries. And, uh, but you can see that well, because of the rather corrupt government Sorry, there's no foreign aid. That's not a way to go. So even for those most corrupted country in the world, they continue to receive foreign aid. So at some stage, there's a one statistic. I think I mentioned that one before. That means that the total amount of foreign capital flowing into Africa country is actually less than the money which actually flow out. So, uh, lot of foreign aid, the money actually being again transferred through different channels into the bank of, uh, Europe, Uh, maybe North America, many Europe And, uh, maybe as a part of, you know, those kind of informal channel, et cetera. So the money actually is not, you know, being utilised to a great extent to address the local need. And, uh, but that is the problem. That's the reality we are facing. So therefore, the UN. United Nations have all these criteria, you know, For those institutional reform and the World Bank, the capacity building is all for that one, you know, but make the programme the aid programme more transparent, more accountable. That was very much related to what we discussed, right? Why the capital productivity? The Sigma is important and how you can make sure that the Sigma is actually larger than the interest rate which you borrow, right. So, uh, as a condition for foreign aid and or debt to contributing positively to economical growth. So that's that's it. But I agree with both comments. That means they are. There's a lot of issue there, right for the recipient country as well as the donor donor. Seems to be, uh, you know, related to the question or challenge of a co ordination. But for the recipient countries, it's just so much more need to do. That's perhaps a part of your writing, right? For the, uh, for the essay to address those issues and the challenges and to be able to, you know, to facilitate those programme. All right, this is nice comments. Yeah, thanks. Question? Yes.

SPEAKER 2
Is that would you raise your question.

SPEAKER 1
Do you raise the question in China? Yeah, I'll say, I'll say, Can you give an example why countries are running current account surplus is extra. Uh, well, the country is the the The question is that can you give an example why countries running current account surplus with, uh, extra foreign exchange cannot convert this, uh, to domestic resources? This is the, uh that's an interesting question. And, uh, the the immediate example I can think about is China. China has a massive or consistent running current account surplus. Why is that? Because the domestic saving is a larger or bigger than the investment they need, right. So there's excessive saving. So therefore, probably there's not much need, you know, to to convert those foreign reserve, uh, into the, uh, the domestic resources. But there's on the financial, Uh uh uh, front. There is a one interesting issue that this is the discussion we can discuss it later on is basically the choices of a foreign exchange regime, whether it's a fixed exchange rate or the floating exchange rate or the crawling exchange rate and et cetera. China has a more or less a fixed exchange rate against, you know, Renminbi yuan against the US dollars. So, by the way, why you are doing that one? There's a one. Precondition. Did not mention about the the impossibility triangle last time I mentioned right. So, uh, independence of monetary policy, free flow of capital and a fixed exchange rate, meaning that you cannot, uh, you know, achieve three at the time. At the same time, you have to compromise one. This compromise is related to your question. Meaning what? When you compromise, you have a fixed exchange rate. You basically lose control of a monetary policy. Why is that? Because the central authority or the central bank has an obligation to maintaining fixed exchange rate. So, for example, if the during the crisis and there's a capital fly or the depreciation of your currency, so what do you do? You basically you can. This is the issue, really to you can convert those, uh, you know, the, uh, the foreign reserve right into domestic money supply and in order to you want to to fix the exchange rate. This is a very popular, you know, discussion on that one, except on that one. So, uh, there will be probably less need for the country. So the big $3 trillion more than three trillion now still sitting there on the car. Of course, there's a many use overseas and etcetera, but not so much on the domestic. And, uh, during the, uh I think before a crisis, there's a There's a debate saying that the government should utilise those foreign currency reserve to actually to support and convert to the domestic, uh, you know, resources helping people, for example. But, uh, but never never being, uh, being implemented. And, uh, because I, I guess, in theory, is the excessive saving so enough saving nationwide. So therefore not much need but except in terms of the, uh, those kind of, uh uh, impossibility triangle those kind of discussion. Uh, second, Isha, the question to say it's a little bit hard to hear right now, OK? Yeah. OK, you hear? Now it's fine now, OK, All right. So any other questions? So let me, uh, shift our attention to the, uh to the similar topics, Ok, very much related. And a bit of an update. Yeah. Please stop me. If you have a question. I think it is sometimes It's more interesting than I just myself talking all the time.

SPEAKER 2
Mm. We wanted to know about the debt crisis of SR I Lanka.

SPEAKER 1
Thank you so much. The, uh Yeah. You talk about the crisis in general And, uh, that crisis in the past 1982 starting from Mexico and then spread to Latin America and some African countries. But the question is that what about the current crisis? And what about what happened to to a ska and, uh, again, it's a very similar thing. It's about the balance of payment issues. And, uh, Sri Lanka also, you know, being regarded as kind of a rising star in the emerging economy. At some state, everything seems seems to so promising. And suddenly you can see the country running into severe balance of payments. Crisis very severe. Basically, basically, you know, is the the two gap things you cannot fulfil the obligation in paying back the debt. No way. And, uh so therefore, the restructuring everything you you know you're taking place. I think perhaps we can leave it to, uh uh, lecture. 11. Well, uh, there we we we talk about the balance of payments constraint, growth so it will be more relevant and to discuss, uh, because we will discuss the east east, uh, East Asian financial crisis. Those are, you know, the lessons we learned. But those lessons actually also quite apply to the current in sa so more or less the same set of issue. But let's let's talk about that later on in the letter 11. OK, but again, thank you for pointing out. You know, it's actually the current happening. In fact, after, let's talk about this one, because I'll give you some data to show that, uh, the developing country during, uh, covid, perhaps now, in the post covid period, you can see the tremendous challenges you know, for fulfil those kind of, uh, the obligation. Yeah. Good question. Yes, please.

SPEAKER 5
Uh, yeah. Thank you. I'm interested with what you explain a little about the impossible triangle. So, um, with the impossible triangle and debt when, uh, a country have a debt, and it's a high, huge amount of debt. So they need to, uh, keep the exchange rate, uh, stable because they want the debt not rising all the time. So they would go to fix fixed exchange rate. But Well, if you fixed exchange rates, they become more vulnerable to, uh, uh, shop from outside. So it's like a dilemma, right?

SPEAKER 1
Because you're borrowing right. But you have to pay back the borrowing. But in most cases in foreign currency, for example, in US dollar. So if you are in the running into prices, your currency tend to be depreciating, right? That means that for the repayment, the burden is even more so because that is in a foreign currency and at the same time, depreciation can actually try to enhance your competitiveness. Right? So that's a good thing in a way. But in many cases, that is the, uh the debt burden resulting from the depreciation of the currency overwhelmed the benefit of a competitiveness because of the, uh, the, you know, maybe due to the external environment or exporting et cetera. So there's a pros and cons, and, uh, at the lecture 11 we put all them framework. We are talking about those, uh, the terms of trade and the the the, uh, you know, the, uh the, uh the the price issue. And, uh, but terms of trade in particular, uh, at that time, OK, so I know there's a there's a choices you have to make right, and the fixed exchange rate is the most countries you know. Adopt that one because what the fluctuation from the exchange rate, the market were somehow very much, you know, affect their economic activities, including the policy of receiving for foreign direct investment. Not just give you one example. If the foreign direct investors are expecting to have a 5% return by investing in your country. But however the currency actually depreciates about 10% right, you know they have a 5% loss incurred to those investors. They won't come and just to buy the change of exchange rate. But right now we are actually facing not just a S ranka but so many emerging economies, right? Just the last week, the 322 to 3 days ago, when the Federal Reserve in US saying that no, probably we have to, because the data on the macroeconomic data in March have a rather strong growth of the economy, labour market and overall spending. So the inflation somehow being kept rather relatively high, federal said, No, we won't. We won't. We won't reduce or cut interest rate for the time being before that one market expecting at least a three time a cut. Right. So therefore, when market factor in when the, you know US exchange rate are being lower, the, uh, every everyone else will have some kind of a breathing space. Because if you don't cut, that means US the US. Uh, yeah, the the dollar index. Uh, after that news just, you know, increase something like 106. So tremendously so all the currency in Asia, you know, Vietnam, India. I don't know about, uh, you know, the, uh, Indonesia, China and Japan in particular, all depreciating. So that's why people are saying that we are repeating the situation back to 1991 97 about the East Asian financial crisis. So all depreciating. But the Federal Reserve was saying that no, you know, we haven't done the job yet, so they won't de sorry. It won't cut interest rate. At least for now. They send a signal. So now the market actually try to digest, You know, those kind of, uh, the policy. But for those countries, very awkward. Why is that one? Because the US dollar will be very high, strong, so new currencies are somehow weaken as a result. If there's any countries, is a boring related to what you have just said, it's terrible. So those countries will try to raise their interest rate right and to to narrow the differences. But result is to have a negative impact on their own economy, the growth. So right now it's actually struggling. All of them is a struggling Japan Japanese yen. Now, more than 30 years now, it depreciate into a great extent. So at some stage, 160 the back up a bit, But again, the the forces are there. So that's the situation. So for developing country, you know, it's basically you cannot set right. You have to follow those kind of exchange rate of a fixed one, try to minimise certain risk, but also you running into another risk. As you just said, Thanks, I think we need to go to the, uh, the seminar now the the same topic very much related, very much related to the lecture now about foreign aid. Right now, this is the, uh, rising global debt level. We already warned you before, right? So let's get some BA basic effects, uh, organised and, uh, and also perhaps also identify certain trends. So why do global debt levels keep rising over time? That's the question, right? Why? And as we know, there's a in the lectures, we talk about the debt crisis. We also talk about, uh, optimal, uh, borrowing right. 80% of that over the country's export. But why, You know, country tend to have a tendency to go beyond those, uh, kind of, uh, optimal level. And what are the impact of the, uh, the covid and, uh, on the increasing debt level, especially for developing countries? So what are the benefits of borrowing for development? We already this one will be brief, right? Because everyone knows in the position to answer that question. Basically, UT utilising you know, those are the framework. The two gap in particular. How can we cope with the challenges of a rising debt in the development, the context, which is basically the policy option. So this similar discussion is, uh, very much related to the lecture, right? And, uh, in terms of, uh, those act, I'll give you a bit of data. Here is the, uh, the the global debt level, right? And, uh, this is the It's not actually very much the latest, but it's a 322% of global GDP. That's the red line in terms of percentage. The blue bars to show the, uh is the total amount of global debt when I look first time to look at this one, actually, I was really surprised because you can see the, uh, the the debt level just increasing basically all the time. And, uh, of course, this is the You can trace this back further, but again, you know, by 2012, it's a relative low, right? It's a relative low. But that is to continue to, uh, of course, at some stage in the, uh, 2016 17. You know, it's a peak coming down a bit, but then, you know, as a share is increasing all the time. Quite shocking, right? You know, $1 of GDP you have a more than $3 of debt, so basically, the growth can be, you know, being kind of a power through through a borrowing and a debt. So this is the again you can see, the, uh is related to uh uh, uh public debt, which basically that that a blue one or the purple light purple, but also household debt. And then it was also non financial corporation their debt. So you can see this is all rising. But, uh, again, you know, we can see that the global financial crisis 2007, you can see there's a sharp increase, right? And then we can come to the, uh, the covid you can see again. There's a sharp increase of debt. So meaning that the the debt, the crisis economic crisis can trigger some kind of a borrowing. Right? Because of what? Because, uh, because the, uh, you know, the house is on fire, so therefore, it's the emergencies. So therefore you can see the the debt increasing by government. But also, you know, household debt, uh, are also increasing in the way. And, uh, so when you look at that, one is basically give you a bit of a decomposition about those one. Now, let's look at the, uh, the UN, uh, kind of a warning. And, uh, we're seeing that this is actually back to 2022 in the middle of the crisis. The covid crisis warning that the series of debt crisis is not taking hold in the pool pool is the part of the world. This the poor, poorest part can be related to the things we mentioned in the lecture, which is the P. Uh, you know, most, uh, you know, uh, the indicted, Uh uh uh, poor countries. So, uh, U NDP also estimated 5254 countries according to more than half of the world poorest people now needed immediate debt relief to avoid even more extreme poverty and give them the chance to dealing with climate change. You know, those are also need financing in a way. In a sense, this actually also related to S Iran's case, right? The crisis actually fermented before the covid in the country, but the covid will make the situation much worse. So U NDP urged the string of a measure including writing off debt and countries start doing that way and offering a wide relief to a great number of countries and even adding special clause to the bond contract to provide the briefing space during the crisis. It's just too much. This is actually the warning during the crisis you can see the data on 20. This is the first year of, uh, of covid at that time. You know, for developing countries, the global debt is already reaching very high level. And, uh, then, of course, uh, not just of a developing country, but developed country as well. So, uh, again, you know, at that time was a being forecast that there, uh uh will be very difficult to work to cope with those crises. And, uh so well, the covid, uh, pandemic. This is again. You know, back to the, uh, uh, example of 20 2100 low and middle income countries. We still have to pay the combined $130 billion in debt service on that year so you can see the situation, right? And, uh, when when countries are dealing with the crisis. But the debt payment, This is the things we discussed, right? And, uh, perhaps also against the big foreign exchange changes. Basically, US dollars become stronger and stronger. That means the the debt burden become higher and higher as a result of that one so extraordinary the figure during the crisis. But they have to do it right but again many countries is what is the through borrowing to pay back the loans outstanding with interest rate by borrowing more? That's the situation for that. So with much economic activities suspended, physical revenue is in free fall. So many countries still will be forced to default. According to Joseph ST it's a very short paper writing at the time, saying that the default rate will be will be will be higher. Now, this is the, uh, the covid affecting, uh, developing countries, external debt and the sustainability and, uh, through several transmission channels basically working simultaneously in the form of unprecedented non-resident portfolio capital outflows. That means the, uh, the for those countries. You know, when you have this, uh, very strong sorry, very high inflation in the way as a result of high interest rate in the United States. So there's a tendency right for what? For the capital of life from developing country? Because they want to move to their portfolios in the investment where they have, uh, they can generate high returns. So that's the situation, right? And, uh, reduction in foreign direct investment. Of course, this is the the pandemic, also affecting that one And, uh, there's a virtual collapse of the, you know, tourist industry that is also related to SR, ranka and, uh, used to be tourists that provide very important source of earning the foreign exchange earning. But, uh, again during the crisis that added pressure, right, but not just for Sri Lanka. For many other countries, it's the same thing, right? But now you can see the the tourist is picking up, But, uh, even in Australia now, you can see the, uh, the, uh very difficult to readjust in a in a way. And a few months ago, we, uh, we went to Sydney during the weekend, so we were at the Chinatown and to have some, uh uh uh for lunch and, uh, very quiet, relatively quiet. So I asked the owner of the restaurant I said, Where are the tourists? Especially in groups, he said, especially from China. He said none because of the cost of visa and many other some individual but a group. Very few. Now. So, uh, again, it's a picking up after, uh uh, covid, but I probably need more time to see. You know, that's actually back to the level, uh, in a pre, uh, panem level of a tourist anyway, so those are the the channels and perhaps also compounded with slum of commodity prices and Remittances. So when you don't have this, uh, migrant workers, right? Used to be the case in Vietnam and Sri Lanka And, uh, you know, migrant workers, they send the money back, right, But, uh, again during the crisis, that channel of of of, uh of, uh of, uh, INTs also being limited in a way. And that's for apply for many countries. Now, the immediate consequences of the, uh those kind of, uh uh for the for the physical space in many developing countries in the longer term, other shocks, including the climate related disaster. You look at the the news, right? You know, in Kenya Yes, LA yesterday, right? It's just terrible. The flooding and the people again, you know, saying that it's very much a climate related disasters and, uh, again the geopolitical tension, energy and and the prices. So as well as a rising global interest rate, this is probably the most important one, because the the aim at the curbing inflation, but however they have a that impact kind of jeopardising the growth prospect for many developing countries and also the, uh they compromised the this the so called the sustainable Development Goals. You heard that one SDG and which is set by UN and, uh, by cutting the, you know, the poverty by half by 2015. But continue to do so. So those crisis, those kind of a macroeconomic adjustment make this is so hard, the task of reaching, you know, achieving those goals. Uh, very, very difficult. No, this is the challenge We, as we discussed in lecture, I won't go through in the very details because we basically already talk about those things right. For example, the historical position of a developing country as a debtor in foreign currency has been recurrent source of vulnerability to external shocks Because you borrow in foreign currency. When you, as I mentioned, domestic currency depreciated, that added the burden for paying back the debt so that almost like a constant like I mentioned, US dollars become stronger and stronger. So for those countries in a very bad situation now and yeah, that's right, because it's again related to the Sri Ranka case. This is because the servicing of external debt obligation ultimately requires generating sufficient export earnings or other form of income. Right. But when the exporters are coming down, the tourists are not coming. And, uh, the money from the migrant workers are sending back is also limited. Where are the channels? You can secure those kind of a source of revenues from overseas, therefore, to generate those kind of revenues in paying back the debt. So not possible. That's why in the SR i Lanka case, the situation become worse and worse until suddenly people realise the country more or less in a default. That means that the the the nation in a in a default so uh which is a which is a terrible situation. It's all related. This issue we have covered but also related to the issue of a balance of payments constraint growth in which there are several important variables are working right, including the price in terms of alys of demand for both import export but also related to income. Alys of demand for import and export, apart from that one is related to the terms of trade, and, uh and uh, it's all related to growth in the way Yeah, that's another one. That means the exchange rate of volatility is likely to affect the value of debt. As we know on externally, that of export earning in opposite direction. Uh, the point we have just discussed. Now, can't you see the title of, uh, he hides it with you? Who to? Oh, that's better. So OK, yeah. Thanks. So why do global debt level keep rising over time and, uh, looks like a puzzle, Right? So we know that you know the vulnerabilities for countries to evolve, right, evolve. So, you know, borrowing too much. But why they keep doing so. Developing economies have increasingly raised the development finance on a commercial term in the international financial market. Uh, the things we talk about us a lot about the foreign aid, right from international agencies, but also from a government. But there's a lot of borrowing actually take place in a in a commercial on a commercial term. This is actually the point we are going to discuss or highlight when we discuss the Asian financial crisis, right. And, uh, so they have also opened their domestic financial market to non residents investors, and they have allowed their citizens and the firms to borrow and invest abroad again. You know why you're freeing up? This is the the lecture we discussed last week, right? Financing development from domestic sources and, uh, the the the investors allowed to take money in and out more freely when you have the capital account liberalisation. But again, that is so vulnerable, right? And when you have a relative fixed exchange rate and you want to keep that one But when you have a free flow, this is the triangle thing, the free flow of capital, the capital, even the residents or non residents. Investor can take money out more easily now. Then you have to try to defend that fixed in. So by doing so, you lose the independence of monetary policy. That's a triangle thing, right? As an example, while increased access to international financial market can help capital scarce countries to quickly raise the much needed funds as we, uh, this lecture, uh, demonstrated it also exposed them to a higher risk profile of debt, contract the short term maturities and more volatile financial cost, as well as to send them reversals of capital gain. Uh, the private capital inflows. This is all happening in each crisis, and, uh, it actually happening now. So in conjunction with other exhaustion shocks such a natural disaster, you know, like a pandemic and, uh, climate change and or even the political instability. So external debt burdens deemed sustainable by international creditors have quickly become unsustainable. So people think, you know, money is available, so let's keep doing that one. But given all this, uh, problem the vulnerabilities, you can see that, uh, so many countries now is not sustainable at all. And Sri Lanka is only just a one example. It's not sustainable. So, uh, the lecture, the final, uh, the, uh, part of the lecture those solutions will probably repeat some of them are most relevant right now, OK? Including debt restructuring and debt relief. Otherwise, there's no way to, you know, to keep the, you know, situation going. Yeah. So what are the benefits for Bo? I won't go through because we already talk about right. And the two gap. Everyone, uh uh, knows that one, including the government, right? And, uh, what they can do. Oh, especially there's a one point is about a counter cyclical physical policy, And that happened during the covid crisis in the financial crisis. The same thing government borrow the money actually to support, you know, financial market, for example, Not to mention about the supporting people, uh, supporting firms. And, uh, again, you know, at a very high uh uh, expenses of, uh, of a government, Uh uh, debt. And, uh, this is we all we, we all observe, right? The boost of demand activity in economic downturn. Now, how can we cope with the challenge of rising debt in the development of context? This is I won't repeat the data now, but let's go to the, uh, the policy options for dealing with the debt burdens and the crisis. There's several points. I think these are. They are all very relevant right now. It's not a textbook stuff, OK, this is the real challenge in real life. So therefore those policies are somehow are very relevant. Number one the government need to put in place the mechanism an institution that help them strike the proper balance between the benefit and the cost of additional debt. That means not just from a policy per SE, you have to have a mechanism for those recipient countries for example, and to have a proper balance between that one. There's a yes, we know it is beneficial because what because there's a gap. So therefore you can allow you like I mentioned at the beginning of the day, that borrowing allows a country to do two things right to import more than it export to save to. Sorry to invest more than it saves, right? It's basically to get it is beneficial in a way. But you answer that question. Where is the balance? Because what? Because there's so much cost involved, including the cost of a rising cost of servicing debt. That's the situation. So but finding that a mechanism and institution is a challenge so very much related to previous discussion about strengthening the structural structural lending right or the capability of the story the governors institution, human capital is the same thing. So this include the so called sound debt measurement and high debt transparency. Well, this is the must. Now, you perhaps you can somehow, you know, get along with the old practise in the past, but right now, you know it's a difficulty unless you make this change. The donors, perhaps the new lenders won't won't land anymore because there are so much cost involved. So this is, uh, have to have this, uh, the debt management, you know, improved and make the whole project and the debt uh, management transparent, transparent. That's one thing international creditors can support sustainable borrowing by implementing prudent lending standards. These are things I will touch upon in the lecture, but I want to emphasise again, This is so important. You have also have a obligation and responsibility for making the landings are more accountable, more more accountable. There's a prudent lending not just saying that we have the budget. I said this before, right? We have to spend all the money. So it doesn't matter how you run a programme. The money continue to come. No. So this is the kind of, uh the PL standard, including in terms of transparency, appropriately distributing risk and ensuring the productive use of debt, that productive use that is back to our lectures, right? About what? About the productivity of Count Sigma, right? How you can actually make sure that the sigma is higher than interest rate, But right now we know the interest is so high globally. So therefore it's across the board is happening is applied to every country that are facing those kinds of challenges. And, uh so the hope is that for US to control the inflation so therefore they can actually on the way to reduce cutting the interest rate. So cutting interest rate will be given a briefing space for many Asian economy. OK, you can tell all the emerging economies otherwise, those countries just so tense they can. They want to economic recovery from the pandemic, but they cannot raise interest very much. But without really raising the interest rate, you suffer from a capital Sorry, the currency depreciation and capital for life and of course added, you know, the cost of servicing debt as well. Can you see the the situation right now with that one so very important to change? And the second point is that the benefit of stability and oriented the physical monetary policy framework cannot be overstated. So that means the, uh, have you heard about the mo modern monetary theory? Modern monetary theory. Previously the money issuing is very much according to certain things right, for example, like Hong Kong have a monetary board when they are running the issuing the money. They also purely based on how much foreign exchange they have, and so therefore they have an anchor for issuing money. But the modern money theory is that no such constraint, you just basically government borrowing government debt can can can do it through issuing money. This is what us is doing. And again, it's actually what China is doing right now. Massive government debt in terms of the bond but central bank printing money and to fulfil that way but that actually it can stabilise the economy. Right growth. But however, that the benefit you have to think about that the benefit in a structural sense or in a way, in a long term sense rather than in the short term, right, short term can, uh, politician always have a growth, especially in time of crisis, but also in the aftermath of the crisis? But however there is a long term structural problem can be caused very controversial about that theory. Being applied to many countries in the US is a typical example, But US is a special because the US is a reserve currency country, right? Basically printing money, they treat a current account deficit and then, you know, they can use that money right from a capital account to, uh, to meeting the requirement of the global economy. But anyway, that's the second point. So I have to be cautious about, uh, doing that one. The third point is that the financial sector policies need to be designed to foster responsible private sector borrowing. Well, this is the thing. Remember the charts. I just show you the corporate sector. The, uh, the debt is also increasing all the time. So whether we can make that money through corporate governor system reform but also in conjunction with the financial sector reform to be able to, you know, to to have some kind of a discipline on the private borrowing. This includes the robust supervisory and regulatory framework, as well as the corporate and the bank bankruptcy framework that allows the prompt debt resolution to limit the damage from debt distress. This is the basically, you know, in insolvencies, right? So when the company cannot run it, you know you have the proper procedures to solve that problem. Otherwise, you continue to have the debt, you know, boring and continues, right, so yesterday and uh, I. I came to office on the way I listen to the news, and you heard that there's, uh, the airline, right? The bonsai. Suddenly it just enough granted all the aeroplane thousands of people, many in Queensland, are linking back to more than a bit. But because the company is insolvent in the morning, they said no, you know, No, no flight. But in the afternoon, they claim that the insolvency that basically going through bankrupt is a bankruptcy. You know that. Of course it is so disruptive, right? In a way. But that is one way for dealing with those crisis and, uh, you know, establish those kind of a market system. It just happened right yesterday. And the fourth is that it is essential to have a strong corporate governance practise. I already mentioned that one effective bankruptcy and insolvency regime to deal with that one. Otherwise, if we try to keep to keep all the companies profitable or unprofitable, afloat and, uh, in the pretext of, you know, maintaining the social stability, you can see this all the existence of a zombie firm will be there everywhere, everywhere. So those, uh, firms have, uh you know, attract those resources, right? Those resources should be redirected into most productive sector of the economy. And then you can see that Oh, everything else will be improved. But so that's why the final point here the fourth one is really, really important now to go through those kind of procedures, right To allow the very inefficient firm to actually go to bankrupt and bankrupt through bankruptcy, you can see the resource allocation or reallocation uh, can be improved. No, of course, it's a pity the world lacks an effective global system to deal with the debt because the world consists of so many countries, right. But we do have a global government or the central global government. No. So, therefore, the wire design the debt relief through a combination of a temporary standstill with a sovereign debt and, uh, the restructuring, including the further enhancing the skill and the cope of G 20 common framework for debt treatment. This actually framework is very effective because they can, including writing of the debt and, uh, to help developing countries cope with the war of oncoming sovereign debt. The payments this is likely to be necessary to address not only immediate liquidity pressures, but also to restore the long term external debt sustainability in many countries, that will continue to be the case, right? You know, because the gap, but whether we should find a way to make it the most sustainable. That's the question. In case of sir, for example, Sorry, it's not sustainable. And so therefore, the help needed for those country. And, of course, not least with the post pandemic view of achieving 2030 agenda for development. Those goals are still there, right? We we want to fulfil and achieve that one. And, uh, but again, the debt, the effective global system, we are liking that one. And, uh, so G 20 is one of the example perhaps other, uh, other arrange of global arrangement can can also help, because without those help, you know, you know the chart as you know, the share of GDP. You know, the the debt in GDP will continue to grow. And, uh, again, there's an intergenerational, uh, issue there. So the question we ask, perhaps we can use the next 2015, 20 minutes to discuss the the state. What are the stake? Right. And, uh, through lecture And also through this, uh, the seminar discussion can word cope with the rising debt problem in an environment in which the global interests are rising, as we just mentioned, which increase the cost of paying back the debt, let's discuss that one. Can we cope? And what sort of a solution can be there? I mentioned the possibility for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rate right from now on. Perhaps not now, for the time being, but maybe in the second half of the year. So by doing so, that's one way of doing that one. But also in in discussing the question, you can also think about the four point I have just a highlight, right? The four point arrangement. But thinking about those mechanism, why that is necessary. The second question that the current high level of global debt leads to another financial crisis. Right? We already observed right those crisis and, uh, during the covid. What happened to Turkey? What happened to Argentina? What happened to South Africa? Those are emerging economy, all running into the so so called severe balance of payments. Uh uh uh. Crisis, in a way, with the simple Is that including a very high inflation capital flight depreciation of your currency. And on top of that one, you know, you can see all the the stress on the on those economy. And so whether there's a potential to trigger another financial crisis and, uh, no, no one can rule it out. Yeah, basically. But if there's a financial crisis, terrible, right, because we will repeat the same thing in dealing with the crisis. You add more debt into the system, and, uh, so it will be very difficult in the longer run to readjust all the structure but also make the things more sustainable. The third question. What are the policy options for dealing with the debt burden for developing country again? Relating that the four point, but also relating to the, uh, to the discussion towards the end of the lectures, right about those are those are measures. Finally, what are the key lessons from the past debt crisis occurring in developing countries? It happened before, but it happened repeatedly since then. So and then we we we need to answer that question in that in that context, right? Why we are repeating the same thing. Can we do better. I'm part of a individual. I'm part of a firm. I'm part of a government, and I'm part of a global agencies, you know, global setting. So all the the questions are related so everyone have a certain obligation right for doing that one and, uh, to find a proper solution to that one. So So I think this, uh, today's, uh, uh, lecture at a seminar and, uh, in conjunction with the one we have covered last week that we're probably talking about, Uh, those financing development. In a very nice way. Last week we talked about the financial liberalisation, right, Financial deepening. Right, So this is very good, but however, the beneficial effect will be offside. But the negative effect of opening because those vulnerability, right, those are boring, you know, too much boring. And those vulnerability in terms of exchange rate and in terms of, uh, you know, capital for life and in terms of the heavy burden of paying back the debt. So all these things will be very much related in you know, these two lecture will connect very well. So you have to think about that one and, uh, in in a broader context of a financing. So, uh, any questions? If no question, I think we still have 20 minutes and let's organise the online group Can do that.

SPEAKER 2
We have one, right? So hi, Honour students, You may take a screenshot for

SPEAKER 6
the questions. Sustain the recording.

SPEAKER 2
I will take it So I will open the breakup

SPEAKER 6
room for you. Please join it for free. Please.

SPEAKER 1
You will have like Fif around 15 minutes for discussion.

SPEAKER 2
Oh, usually the question is too broad because basically thinking about mhm Sure, right. We No. OK, the interest rate for the debt for Manchester. And I just, uh there is a you know, for every country there is a threshold, right? So Bangladesh, we are enjoying the thought that but for taking the kind of for. So currently we are facing some of the problems like maybe we will solve the step. The what threshold. So they charge us like to that rights our in servicing. So the interest rate that so show the debt servicing is increasing. We have to have money, uh, in our budget to pay back. I got only for those and below these metric can also be But the United States, I So I kind of an intriguing one. Because in this time, want to become young, like virus too much. But I don't a lot of properties, which might be bad. Yeah, OK, have you not? No, no. Well, I mean, we don't have much in the street in trade. Say you have to. So, government debt debt. So for more or less that like Like like like yourself de la in we pay our US dollar. Yeah, sometimes we are be there. Ah, yen. But most th mhm. Yes, very. Um you know, um uh, yeah, that car season. I think at least Indonesia that even if is that even, uh, Newport or foreign wouldn't have, um So So the exchange or forest, um also teach you so there in Malaysia. I know, because I think government Bye. You still what? So the race is, um, record prices, um rising? Yes, I think when surgery something everywhere. Because I think that for your long term rates are also still very much and shot them. Oh, um, your overnight wait. So? So that has a, um, U strategy that is still and we financial crisis. Um OK, so seen my episodes, right? You see, my, um I think like that issues. Right? But we haven't actually correct systemic crisis IIII I can't ignore that won't happen. But it does look like it, because you think that has no, uh right. So also was to me to do, um um, ST Licence se you hope? Yeah, us. Well, from the very first place that the country goes into because goes into a crisis. Usually that the companies try to save them first. For example, Like in case of Greece in 2008, like the European Central Bank. Try to say, Chris verse by being an owl. So is it even possible that question number two Detroit can help them out? But not every country has that back. Stop. Where, um, the the tracker was able to actually. So not all have that level of all over. I don't know why Argentina Ireland was so generous in Argentina. But, I mean, you can see, like I we were doing all the right things, right? And then and then next, I just want like like three of or Sri Lanka can get. What do that. I see It has its back to the US as well. So that, like, through the IMF and the US and the programme, right? And now they're finding the I mean, so it's like that. Have a backstop or something. May not necessarily have that already. State of Miami. That's very good. That's very good. And, uh, also good question.

SPEAKER 5
Very brief.

SPEAKER 2
Be on Is the, uh, to some sense necessary to present, But that is really not 13. Uh, you have you Very nice, but I was treated. Oh, yes. Mhm. If it is, you can see the top. But we want that. Oh, so I think not Indonesia.

SPEAKER 5
So you mentioned this is like what you said in Malaysia.

SPEAKER 2
That's a lot of hard time that the activity is

SPEAKER 5
over.

SPEAKER 2
We will be stressful.

SPEAKER 5
So, uh, it's not really safe to see, but, um

SPEAKER 2
uh, according to the cost of yeah, for that.

SPEAKER 5
So, um, the cost of that is, you hide them or load them getting W. So our office praise me that, um oh, for yeah.

SPEAKER 2
So let's say so.

SPEAKER 5
There's usually some sketch on the theories.

SPEAKER 2
I even the developed countries there are reducing the grant. We plan. So they? No, Uh, like you were saying that with every plan there is some, like restrictions. They're special. Maybe, uh, you have to apply by some of their restriction. So that's why the countries are not interested there Because of that, I my pictures and then ask for, uh, rising. So, uh, what I What I'm trying to say is

SPEAKER 5
that, uh, to manage this, we need to make sure that we have, uh, enough reserve for that and one

SPEAKER 2
of the one of the ways.

SPEAKER 5
By increasing production of Indonesia, Uh, the expert is increasing the frame by not just exporting the premier product, but by using that to make a new third year product secondary product so increasing the value of the export and increasing the amount reserve that the economy had So that kind of effort could, uh, reduce the the risk. And the second part is for police policy. So the the the, uh uh, World Bank, the bank of, uh, the the Bank of Indonesia is not only the start focusing on, um, free flow, uh, ex ex ex rate, but it's more like combined, so it's like targeting. It's not like, uh, letting it free floating, but also not fixing it to a one to kind of like,

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, like, combination of, understand. So if all the we have D 100 the way that challenge step is currently Bre increase our foreign reserve have the So the government is trying, but this is a major challenge with the rising debt cost. We are not looking at the fact that we have increase. Uh, you know what? To give that on the other side. This is a dilemma that we are. Yes. Um 1000 was you just Oh, no, no. Export oriented. Which is fine, is how it is. So something say something amazing. But it first question infrastructure we see for and then just reinvest it in. Right. So we are We are in need of ours. I think we are seeking for, uh, other than you. The plan for those ones. Not agree. Yeah, some. And I think that you can use some song a short term focus. Uh, some something with them pronounced. Do it. Or first and last week for different. And so it's a different process. We have pharmacy. Pharmacy has been have to have foreign assistance. It would be Yes, mostly our bombs to. So there's a policy in line. We OK forest the second long term projects than in maybe or short. I guess management, uh, to do that is because the

SPEAKER 5
investment and saving is, uh there's a gap right there. So you need to invest 20. Plus, you need that.

SPEAKER 2
You can just like at work. Really? Before his entity was started in one that if you don't have technical for assistance, they technical assist. Two I, sir. Sorry. A, uh, sorry wait song in the past. Quite resume. Resume to call them back. How did they find?

SPEAKER 1
Ok, let's take one minute, OK? Yeah, that's that's good. So thank you. Just listen to what you said. And so, uh, I like to use 12 for one. student from, uh, online group to to present perhaps also one from, uh, the, uh the person to present very briefly. And then I can probably don't have time to summarise, but, uh, I can echo some of the point because I see, So it will take about. So why not you?

SPEAKER 2
Yes. Teachers.

SPEAKER 7
Yeah. I mean, I mean, just to summarise this is more of the optimistic view that one is that we're a little bit more optimistic about. Despite the backdrop of rising interest rates, we have seen that emerging and developing economies have improved their frameworks, their debt management frameworks. We can see the structure of borrowing has improved maturity structures better. There's also been development of domestic domestic debt, so that's actually positive. But of course, there are still key lessons and policy options. One is you still need to continue improving your fiscal frameworks, making sure that that really debt and fiscal positions are sustainable. So that is being used for things that are actually productive. Second, right, that is also important. I think it's monetary policy, independence, Um so so so That helps to anchor efficient expectations. And I think that that's also important, you know, when you have high levels of debt. And third, I think somebody mentioned that structural reform is also important, basically that that as you borrow more, you also want to make sure that foreign exchange earnings are also higher, are also commensurate with the higher debt burdens. I also think that exchange of flexibility itself is important, so when you do have exchange of flexibility. You and you do have foreign investors in your domestic market. It does instil some sort of market discipline on the borrower. Um, I think that that's important. So you so governments are mindful that you can't be doing whatever that you want with the debt that you have, because at the end of the day that debt is has to be paid, the receipts will come to you. Uh, yeah. And also, I think, just to better make use of IMF um, programmes um, you know, you have, like, technical assistance, plus, um, plus the plus the money itself. So I think that that those are things that that are one Some of the key lessons.

SPEAKER 1
The online group to speak. Yeah.

SPEAKER 6
Any volunteers from online students have a 12 student there?

SPEAKER 1
Yes, it is.

SPEAKER 8
Um, OK, so I'm just gonna very quickly sum up because a lot of people presented some really nice ideas, So if they want to jump in, please do So, Um, but basically, we answered The first question was, um maybe obviously we need good policies, but we do think that rising debt presents like a very concerning problem. Um, we spoke a lot about examples of, um, like, as to Mexico, we also talked about, like a few different countries in the religion. Um, such as Sri Lanka. Um, we, um we talked about a high level of global debt. Could lead to another financial crisis. Yes, because we talk about how we live in an increasingly globalised world and all the countries, so depending on, you know, one another, and then obviously we have kind of the dominant effect. Um, where Certain countries for countries that are highly dependent on it, especially in terms of trade, um, will be impacted. Um, in terms of policy options, Uh, we talked a lot about how interest rates, um, like both monetary and fiscal policy play a big role. And, um, interest rates government spending, um, are a lot of big lessons. And, um, yeah, I guess that kind of ties into that where, um And then, uh, Tia made a good point. That, like, um, you know, exporting volume was a good indicator to reflect the ability of a country to pay debt. And so maybe that gives you, like an early warning sign as well. Like your economists working in the government in the public sector. You can kind of see what track the government is kind of going on. Um and so basically, we were looking at, um, alternate sources in terms of if the government is unable to pay it back, what can they kind of do? We're talking about how, like, you know, there's a lot of involvement of other countries and, um, the nonprofits, like the IMF and the World Bank, that sort of get involved and then do the bailout loans and all of that, but then also linking it with development of infrastructure, Um, and building up human capital and, like, increasing basic resource that you have in the country. Um, that was very chaotic, but if anyone has anything to add OK, OK, yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Uh, thank you very much. Uh, Isha, I think, uh, we need to stop here. So before I introduce the, uh, uh, tweet to give you a bit of an idea and advice on writing your essay, let me just highlighting one point. I think today's a similar discussion is the one I received the most questions from your audience. So which, uh, you know, it's amazing, you know, previously, most of the students are relatively quiet. But today, you know, so many questions are being raised. So I enjoyed this kind of interaction, and I also thought it maybe it took too long for you to actually warm up, you know, to to speak and more actively. So we have a remaining three lectures. I hope that towards the end and more interaction and more discussion and the lecture being all recorded so other students can benefit from those kind of interaction. So I'd like to thank you for that one. So now I hand it to to to And it's very useful now to know basically, the road map right on writing is a is a two more three more ways to go. It's really time for you to actually put, uh, you know, your attention on this, uh, this task. So to have all this advice for us? Yeah. Thank you very much. Yeah.

SPEAKER 9
Hi, everyone. I'm going to try and do something a little bit different. Um, basically the advice that we gave I gave in relation to the written assignment stands. I'm just more tips. But what I'd like to do is because you've been given uh, a choice out of four questions. And they're on different topics like institutions, trade, foreign aid and resource curse and the environment. If I could ask to Do you mind if you set up, um, four breakout groups. So we're gonna sign, um, a group, um, you into groups, Uh, and And each group will focus on, um, analysing a question, uh, each OK. And then so we'll spend about five minutes analysing a question in your groups. Um, so So maybe group one in the breakout room, um, can deal with the question on the institutions Group two on trade group three, Foreign aid and group four is the resource resource curse. Um, is that OK? So I'll just give you an opportunity to discuss the question. And, you know, in addition to, um, reading the instructions, it's important that you in making a decision about which question to tackle. Um, it's It's a good process to go through. Yeah, so that you You're making sure that you really understand what the question's asking you to do. Um, So this is something that we can do together, uh, and then this way, you can cla clarify what is it that, um lang and toe is really asking you to do in answering? Um the the questions. Yeah, OK, thank you.
