SPEAKER 1
Recording yourself, right?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. All right. OK, thank you very much. Uh huh. No, his son. Sure we can do now is we have just not speak yourself, but always have a wow which and, uh, including online. Maybe Let's, uh, have an online student to speak first. Uh, any representative?

SPEAKER 3
Um, Anna, do you wanna do question one? And, uh So which one do you wanna do? Question two and I can do question three and four.

SPEAKER 2
Yes. Go. Go ahead. Yeah, please. Yes.

SPEAKER 4
Uh, can you hear me?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, we can hear you.

SPEAKER 4
Yeah. Um, so for the first question, um, obviously, there are three main sources of technological progress, and I guess we can classify them as an exogenous and the endogenous factors. So in terms of, like, exogenous when we can, um, import technologies, um, to to to the economy, including the, um, technologies embodied like a capital. And also, uh, FD I and in terms of, um, endogenous factors, Um, the main source would be the, um, innovative activities of entrepreneurs and the, um, and also learning. By doing so, those three will be the main sources of the economy to boost their technological progress. Thank you.

SPEAKER 2
All right, so OK. Uh, uh, anyone else from, uh, online group?

SPEAKER 3
So which one do you want to do? Question two.

SPEAKER 2
Yes. Aha.

SPEAKER 5
Um, yeah. Let me to say something about the demographic dividends. Um, So this phenomenon is about, uh, there are more younger generations, which is, uh, the younger labour force. Which route? Um, sorry. Can you hear me? Uh, yeah. Uh, OK, ok, so this phenomenon is sure that there are more younger labour force which will decrease the dependency ratios. And this can benefit the economy by T the demographic dividends. And this can increase the income per capita and the savings per capita enhance the investment per capita and through the capital accumulation process. So the country may take advantage of the demographic dividends. By this means. Yeah, this is our discussion. Thank you.

SPEAKER 3
Just to ask. Yeah, just to add a little bit. So we spoke about how, um, to tap into, um, that kind of, um, demographic dividend, Um, fostering, like having favourable policies that foster entrepreneurship, um, and that invest in research and development is really important to sort of really be able to take advantage and build the technological capital. And then, um, for the last part we spoke about, um What this call, uh, robot control, which I thought was quite nice. Um, but essentially a I management and incorporating more of that into learning, um, and then having better systems for people to, um be able to learn a lot quicker and then government programmes that actively target and support people during transition periods when they're learning. So you know how like job seeker or jobkeeper in Australia have, like, mutual obligations like that, But like for learning and training. So you have to be learning this new technology or something like that. Um, otherwise, like, you know, the government's not able to support you or things like that. Looking at just having, like, more of an atmosphere that encourages you to learn and grow, um, during transition periods. And then AnAnd also, um, talked about how having good communication skills and ana analytical skills was really important.

SPEAKER 2
All right, OK, so, uh, very good. Uh, thank you so much, uh, for three of you and, you know, to, uh, to speak. And by the way, let me emphasise one point, because you are doing, you know, doing online and, uh, during the discussion. Perhaps, uh, if you really we really want you to be more actively participating and, uh, you know, you know, technology is the allows us to do it. So you can, for example, to, uh, to key in your question, for example, uh, through chat and, uh, 20 year here and I will be trying to, you know, respond to your, uh, questions, uh, and not to just don't wait for the the last, you know, uh, the this case, uh, discussion you can also, through this, uh uh, seminar, uh, discussion. When I talk, you can, uh, type in the questions, OK? If you have. And, uh, from now on, all right. Very good. Thank you. so much. Yeah. So OK, so yes. OK, any questions? Just all common sense.

SPEAKER 6
Just you want my general comments? Oh, dear. Ok, um, so, uh, one of the things that we talked about was, uh uh When a I gets or a I or any sort of technology gets introduced into an economic environment, there's different perspectives from which you need to consider those technologies. So one is the business perspective, which is, um, what is the least cost way for a company to turn a profit? And of often that cannot be to the benefit of the wider population, which is where the policy perspective comes in. Which is, um how can we enable businesses to maximise the productivity while simultaneously protecting our human capital that we have in our society? And that could often relate to, um, training, like keeping one step ahead of the technology by keeping people, um, in an educational context or be willing to pivot to new, to learn new things. That was something we talked about.

SPEAKER 2
It was Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SPEAKER 7
I just give give an interesting example that now may, uh, like a I may be like replace the labour force like, uh, in China. There's now 30 million, like takeaway delivery men. And, like 6 million uber drivers, they are the most hottest job, like, uh, after the pandemic. However, nowadays, those, uh, big companies like Ali like me time they are now invent UAV and, like, driverless, uh, driverless cars to replace them. So I think that more protective policies should be made to protect the labour, Uh, intensive industry, this a policy

SPEAKER 2
to protect it. In fact, that that point is actually very much, uh, in the, uh, in the discussion in facing, uh, those kind of challenges. And, uh, that's also a good example, you know, to to show that one. So thank you. Thank you for adding that one. Sorry, you have a No. OK, any.

SPEAKER 8
We also discuss about the the dividend rate, the the benefits. Yeah, um, we also discussed Get on. Um, we also discussed on how countries can take advantage of the, um the de uh the, um dividend. And, um, we briefly talk about the case in Africa, although they have a higher young population, but it does not translate it into the economic growth. And I think, um, as also discussed in the lecture. Um, well, one thing that you know, how government can take because it's one time opportunity and how it translates into the growth is the, uh through the investing in human capital and investing in human capital. It's in. We discuss in different forms and, for example, in health facilities and also the, for example, institutional training as we discussed as well. And then also, we give, um, uh the examples of of, like, Singapore, even though Singapore is also unlike South Korea because of a ho homogeneous society, um, China and Japan. But Singapore can take advantage of their demographic dividend because, um, they have opened, um, policies where migrations from, for example, not, um part of, uh, um, uh, Asia from India from Bangladesh. Um, and and also, they have also policies in place where, for example, two months ago, when the, um, you know the company one of the biggest company they're trying to sort of like ize the, um um uh, their industry. Actually, the government intervened by providing additional training. Um, for the, uh, the the the labourers, the the workers that was displaced from that in, uh, and provide them with the training to acquire new skills to sort of like, uh, to the new market.

SPEAKER 2
A good example from using a Singapore, uh, group here. Yes, it bi section.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, we discuss, uh, a couple part from question one and two, and also a bit of question three. So, um uh, let me start with question two. So what, uh, how can we can defend it of, uh, demographic dividend we talk about, um um safe safety nets policy. Um, social safety nets policy, which is important because, um, to make it happen, we need to make an equal, um, opportunity to every, um, labour participation to every, um, independent people they brought dem demographic bonus. And what what? What part that we think is important is protecting women and give more, um, policy that, uh, more, uh, get opportunity for women because we need to step back from the old school mindset about women that they they need to stay at the house etcetera because, um, they are also part of the labour participation. So that's important. And then, um, we need to protect the unemployment because they're basically just in waiting unemployment. They will, uh, make into the labour participation sometimes. So we need to protect them and provide some basic needs, like health support, et cetera. And second part is, investment in human capital is the same already been explained. But we also induce that there's a need to make a free education for a certain period, so everyone will have the same opportunity. And, um, we we also, uh, discuss about increase increasing more opportunities, such as in increase the incentive for production. So, uh, not only for the demand side, but also from the supply side. They need to make, uh, make it easier for them to, um, to search for, uh, workers and, um uh, urban participation. So, uh, we need to induce more, um uh, participation not only from rural, but also from, uh, urban participation. And for the, uh, uh, technological process, Um, partly, uh uh, basically the same with everyone else. But we have, uh, capital accumulation here. Uh, as explained by, uh, you previously about the big push. So, uh, we need we need that big push to make it happen. The technical process will move to the, uh, correct, uh, direction. And last the last question about the policy response about automation. We talk about creating another job opportunity. So, uh, the the the the the mm Uh, the industry with Automat. We will always have, um uh, greater, um, comparative advantage. So we cannot restrict that it will be We will make our country a lo comparative advantage with every other countries. But we can make another job opportunity besides the jobs. And there's also, uh, limiting the automat organisation because we don't have to have all of the industries doing ization. We can make it like, Oh, this one is we cannot We OK with this one with ization. But the others, like for elder people, it needs to be a person to handle it. Yeah. Thank you.
