ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Introduction
The central issue facing all economies is how to allocate resources among competing uses. This 
question takes on more significance in developing countries than in developed countries because 
resources are scarcer, the basic needs of people are greater, and the market mechanism as a device 
for resource allocation has many more imperfections. In this chapter, we first review the role of 
the market mechanism as an efficient device for resource allocation, and the various imperfec-
tions and failures that markets may suffer from, which might be corrected by the state. Four roles 
for the state are identified: to provide public goods, to eliminate divergences between private 
and social costs and benefits (which arise because market prices do not reflect the social costs 
and benefits of goods and factors of production), to protect the vulnerable because the market 
mechanism does not guarantee an equitable distribution of income, and to provide an institu-
tional environment in which markets can flourish.
But there can be state failures as well as market failures. Corruption is endemic in many poor 
countries, and there are at least 50 countries in the world classified as failed states that hardly 
function at all, politically or economically.
Finally, the role of planning in developing countries is discussed and some of the broader policy 
issues confronting decision-makers, including types of planning, the balance between agriculture 
and industry, the choice between consumption today and consumption tomorrow, pursuing (or 
not) the law of comparative advantage, techniques of production, and the debate over whether 
growth should be balanced or deliberately ‘unbalanced’.
The market mechanism and market failures
In free-market economies, resources are allocated by Adam Smith’s ‘invisible hand’ of the market 
in accordance with consumer demand. The market is the organizational framework that brings 
together those who supply and those who demand a product, who then trade at an agreed price. 
In a completely free market, the price will clear the market so there are no unsatisfied buyers and 
sellers. Decision-making about what is produced is decentralized and left to the market, compris-
ing the decisions of myriad private individuals. If the demand for a good increases, the price will 
rise and producers will be induced to supply more; if demand falls, the price will fall and produc-
ers will supply less. Market prices act as signals to producers to supply more or less of a com-
modity according to the changing profitability of production. The efficiency of markets relies on 
prices acting as signals, on suppliers responding, and on the mobility of the factors of production 
 
enabling supply to be forthcoming.
This brings us to one of the most important theorems in welfare economics: if consumers 
consume to the point where the marginal utility of consumption is equal to the price of a good, 
and producers produce to the point where the marginal cost of production is equal to price, then 
resources will be optimally allocated, since the marginal utility of production will just equal the 
marginal cost. Society will have reached its highest level of utility consistent with its production 
possibilities. This is illustrated in Figure 9.1.
The curve I1I1 is society’s indifference curve between two goods, A and B, representing the high-
est utility attainable, and X1X1 is a country’s production possibility curve between the two goods, 
A and B. Point 1 represents the optimum allocation of resources between the two goods. Any 
point to the left or right of point 1, or inside the production possibility curve, would represent a 
lower level of utility.

The allocation role of markets is, however, only one of the functions of the market mechanism. 
To use a distinction introduced by Kaldor (1972), the market also has a creative function, to provide 
an environment for change that expands production possibilities – that is, which shifts the produc-
tion possibility curve outwards to X2X2, enabling a higher level of utility at point 2. An environment 
for change means all the dynamic forces that lead to technical progress, innovation and, ultimately, 
investment. In the early stages of development, the creative function of markets, producing new 
opportunities for growth, may be just as important as the allocative function of markets.
The conditions required for markets to perform their allocative and creative functions in an 
optimal manner are very stringent, and are unlikely to be satisfied in any economy, let alone devel-
oping countries. The true benefit of output may not be reflected in price because of externalities; 
price may not reflect marginal cost because of market imperfections; and many developmen-
tal goods and services may not be produced at all because markets are incomplete or missing 
entirely, and therefore cannot perform their creative function. In other words, there are likely to 
be market failures.
In addition, there is the problem that there is nothing in the market mechanism that guaran-
tees an equitable distribution of income in society, or that will direct adequate resources away 
from present consumption to build up the means of production for a higher level of consumption 
in the future.
In the past, all these types of market failure have led development economists to argue for 
government intervention in the development process, as well as leading most developing coun-
tries to interfere with the market mechanism and to adopt various forms of planning for the 
allocation of resources. In the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe, planning 
superseded the market mechanism entirely, and output and resource allocation was decided by 
bureaucrats, not by consumers. In other countries, governments produced plans for the sectoral 
allocation of resources and took on more and more functions. In the latter half of the twentieth 
century, there was an explosion of government expenditure in developing countries, rising to over 
30% of national income on average and to over 50% in some countries.1
In recent years, however, there has been disillusion with planning, and the role of the state has 
come under increased scrutiny for a number of reasons:
1.	 There was the collapse of the former state-planned, communist countries of the Soviet Union 
and Eastern Europe. What to put in their place? Most of these former command economies

have swung to the other extreme, embracing the market mechanism almost unconditionally, 
with other damaging consequences relating to growing income inequality and unemployment.
2.	 In many developing countries, the state has failed to deliver even the most fundamental public 
goods, such as law and order and property rights, and essential social capital and infrastruc-
ture, such as education, health facilities and transport.
3.	 Civil strife has caused the collapse of the state in a number of countries, particularly in Africa, 
leaving markets to operate in an institutional vacuum.
4.	 Many countries have found themselves in fiscal crisis – associated with mounting expenditure 
on the welfare state in developed countries, and huge public enterprise deficits in developing 
countries.
5.	 There is a fascination with the enabling role that the state has played in the successful devel-
oping countries of Southeast Asia – in Japan and the Asian tigers of Hong Kong, Singapore, 
Taiwan and South Korea. Can the East Asian model be copied?
Surveying the experience of developed and developing countries in the years since 1945, the 
message would seem to be that the state has a vital role to play in economic development, but 
not so much as a direct provider of goods and services; rather as the agency through which mar-
ket failures can be rectified and as the architect of a framework in which markets can flourish and 
evolve. History shows that markets can come into existence without government intervention, 
but markets work incrementally. It takes time for price signals to be recognized, for people to 
respond to incentives, and for resources to be (re)allocated efficiently. This does not mean that 
the state should step in and do everything. There is a middle way between state-led, central plan-
ning on the one hand, and the minimal state espoused by extreme free-marketeers on the other. 
The bad experience of government planning in Eastern Europe should not blind us to the market 
failures mentioned earlier. The way forward in most developing countries must be a judicious mix 
of market capitalism combined with state intervention. Let us now consider in more detail the 
role the state can play in correcting these market failures.
The role of the state
The state has four key roles to play in the development process:
1.	 To provide public goods.
2.	 To correct market imperfections.
3.	 To protect the vulnerable and ensure an equitable distribution of income, both intra-temporally 
(between people at a point in time) and inter-temporally (between generations over time).
4.	 To provide an institutional environment in which markets can flourish, including the mainten- 
ance of macroeconomic stability.
Public goods are goods that have certain characteristics that make it difficult, if not impossible, 
to charge for them, and therefore private suppliers will not provide them. These characteristics are:
1.	 Consumption by one user does not reduce the supply available for others – the good is non-rival.
2.	 Users cannot be prevented from consuming the good – the good is non-excludable.
There are not many pure public goods (air is perhaps the purest of all) but there are others that 
come close and are important for economic development, such as defence, law and order, and 
the provision of basic infrastructure such as roads, railways, power supply, sewers and clean water. 
261

A market in defence, or laws governing property rights that benefit the whole nation, is not con-
ceivable. Markets in some infrastructural facilities are conceivable, but not very likely because of 
the high fixed costs. Also, the providers might have difficulty in charging for, and capturing, the 
externalities. The market would either not provide at all, or it would underprovide.
Market imperfections refer to three important phenomena. First, market prices may pro-
vide a very imperfect guide to the social optimum allocation of resources, because they do 
not reflect the opportunity costs to society of using factors of production, or the value to 
society of the production of commodities. The price of labour may be above its opportunity 
cost and therefore used too little. The price of capital and foreign exchange may be below the 
opportunity cost and therefore used too much from a social point of view. Likewise, the price 
of goods may not reflect the marginal cost of production. Monopolies, tariffs, subsidies and 
other imperfections in the market all distort free-market prices, on which private producers 
base their production decisions.
Second, there is the existence of externalities, both positive and negative, which means that 
some goods may be underprovided and others overprovided from a social point of view because 
the positive or negative externality is not reflected in the price. Most infrastructure projects, such 
as transport facilities, power generation, irrigation schemes and so on, and social capital, such as 
education and health facilities, will have greater social returns than the private return and will 
therefore be underprovided from a social point of view unless private suppliers in the market 
are compensated or subsidized. Other activities may produce negative externalities by imposing 
costs on society that are not paid for by the provider, and therefore the market oversupplies from 
a social point of view. Governments can curb negative externalities through regulation or tax- 
ation, and promote positive externalities through subsidies or providing the output itself, as with 
education and healthcare.
Third, markets may be incomplete or missing altogether. One good reason why markets may 
be missing in the case of public goods is the inability of suppliers to exclude free-riders, that is, 
to exclude people from consuming the good once it is provided. But there are other important 
reasons for incomplete or missing markets. For example, high transaction costs can prevent mar-
kets from developing, particularly in developing countries, where poor communications make 
information costs high and there is an absence of futures markets to compensate for risk in condi-
tions of uncertainty. The actual cost of providing a good or service may be less than individuals 
are willing to pay, but imperfect information on the part of consumers leads to an undervaluation 
of the product and therefore restricted supply, for example preventive healthcare. In this sense, 
the market is incomplete.
Asymmetric information, adverse selection and moral hazard can also lead to market 
in­
efficiency. ‘Asymmetric information’ refers to the imbalance of knowledge in a market between 
buyers and sellers. In the market for bank loans, for example, the borrowers know more about 
their own circumstances than the lenders. Banks could make bad loans (‘adverse selection’), which 
makes them cautious and leads to credit rationing. It would be very costly for banks to obtain all 
the information they require on high-risk customers. The informal money market compensates 
by charging very high interest rates for all. Another example would be the health insurance mar-
ket, where individuals know more about their health than the suppliers of insurance. Those who 
know they are prone to illness are more likely to take out insurance, and more likely to be turned 
down. ‘Moral hazard’ is present when the possession of insurance encourages the activity that is 
insured against, leading to resource waste and higher costs (and higher insurance premiums for 
all). Governments may step in by regulating private insurance, or providing the service themselves 
at lower cost.

As far as equity is concerned, the state has an important role to play in protecting the vulner­
able and ensuring an equitable distribution of income between people, between groups in soci-
ety, between regions and across generations. There is not only a moral case for the state to help 
those in absolute poverty, but also a strong political and economic one. Poor, vulnerable and dis-
affected people can be a major cause of civil unrest and political instability (Stewart, 2001). This 
deters investment and growth. It is also important for the state to keep an eye on the welfare of 
future generations, which may require altering the balance between consumption and investment 
in the present. There are a number of ways in which governments can intervene to discourage 
present consumption and raise the level of investment for higher future consumption; examples 
are taxation, subsidized interest rates and public investment on society’s behalf.
Finally, the state is essential for providing the appropriate institutional environment for mar-
kets to flourish and operate efficiently (see Chapter 8). In this sense, markets and government 
intervention are complementary. The World Bank’s (1997) World Development Report 1997: The 
State in a Changing World conveys three principal messages:
1.	 Development (economic, social and sustainable) without an effective state is impossible. It is 
increasingly recognized that an effective state – not a minimal one – is central to economic 
and social development, but more as partner and facilitator than director. States should work 
to complement markets, not replace them.
2.	 A rich body of evidence shows the importance of good economic policies (including the pro-
motion of macroeconomic stability), well-developed human capital, and openness to the 
world economy for broad-based, sustainable growth and the reduction of poverty. But, as our 
understanding of the ingredients of development improves, a deeper set of questions emerges: 
Why have some societies pursued these actions with greater success than others, and how 
precisely did the state contribute to these differing outcomes?
3.	 The historical record suggests the importance of building on the relative strengths of the mar-
ket, the state and civil society to improve the state’s effectiveness. This suggests a two-part 
strategy of matching the role of the state to its capability, and then improving that capability.
The World Development Report 1997 (World Bank, 1997) argues that many developing coun-
tries are not performing their core functions properly. They are failing to protect property, to 
ensure law and order, and to protect the vulnerable, all of which causes unrest and leads to a lack 
of government credibility. Its survey of 69 countries shows that government credibility is highest 
in South and Southeast Asia, and lowest in sub-Saharan Africa and the states of the former Soviet 
Union (World Bank, 1997). Investment and growth are positively related to credibility. The report 
says of Africa that many countries are ‘trapped in a vicious circle of declining state capability and 
thus declining credibility in the eyes of their citizens – leading to increased crime and an absence 
of security affecting investment and growth’ (World Bank, 1997). It refers to a ‘crisis of statehood’ 
in Africa, and a lower ‘state capability’ than 50 years ago. In contrast, it praises the countries of 
Southeast Asia because they have paid attention to the institutional framework for markets to 
fulfil their various roles in allocating and augmenting resources. State credibility is particularly 
important if developing countries are to attract private foreign investment.
The World Bank (1997) outlines a two-pronged strategy for governments to increase their 
credibility and the effectiveness of the state: first, governments must match the role of the state 
to its capabilities and not try to do too much, and second, they must try to improve capabilities 
by reinvigorating state institutions. With regard to the first prong of the strategy, the state should 
concentrate on getting the basics right, such as safeguarding property rights and guaranteeing 
the rule of law, rather than trying to do too much. In many countries, there is overregulation and 
263
9  •  T H E  R O L E  O F  T H E  S TAT E  I N  E C O N O M I C  D E V E L O P M E N T
excessive state consumption. Governments should decide more carefully what to do and how to 
do it. The basics should be:
•
• law and order
•
• maintaining macroeconomic stability
•
• investing in basic social services and infrastructure
•
• protecting the vulnerable
•
• protecting the environment.
But the state does not have to be the sole provider of all infrastructure and social services. It 
can contract these services out to the private sector and introduce competition into their provi-
sion, coupled with a regulatory framework to protect consumers and workers. Neither does the 
state have to be the monopoly supplier of public utilities such as electricity, gas and telecommuni-
cations. These activities can be privatized with state supervision. Privatization has gathered pace 
throughout the world in recent years. There have been thousands of divestitures of state companies 
in developing countries and in the former communist countries of Eastern Europe. The motivation 
has been the generally poor economic performance of state-owned companies, the large deficits of 
public enterprises, and the promotion of competition to improve the delivery of services.
Beyond the basics, the state may want to intervene strategically – in industrial policy, for 
example, if it has the capability, as the successful Asian tiger economies have done. The past suc-
cess of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea has depended on the state and the private 
sector working in harmony with each other, with the state providing the economic and legal 
environment for markets to flourish but with the government taking an entrepreneurial role and 
intervening where it thought necessary. In Hong Kong, the state took a leading role in planning 
infrastructure and providing subsidized housing to maintain social stability and to reduce the cost 
of labour. Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea targeted financial assistance to specific industries 
and even specific companies (with an emphasis on exports), with spectacular success.
On the second strategy of improving the capabilities of the state and reinvigorating state insti-
tutions, the task is to provide incentives for public officials to perform better and reduce the 
scope for arbitrary action that could lead to poor decision-making and corruption.
Corruption
Corruption is a serious issue in many developing countries. An organization based in Germany 
called Transparency International publishes a yearly Corruption Perceptions Index based on sur-
veys of businesspeople, risk analysts and perceptions of the general public, ranked on a scale 0–10 
(the lower the index, the more corrupt). The results for 168 countries in 2015 are shown in Table 9.1.
Developing countries appear to be the most corrupt, although the same level of income (or 
development) is often associated with different levels of corruption. In general, poverty breeds 
corruption, and corruption can lead to severe inefficiencies in the functioning of economies (for 
a comprehensive survey, see Abed and Gupta (2002).
Daniel Kaufmann (2005) at the World Bank reckons that a country that improves its govern-
ance from a low average level (and reduces corruption) could triple its average per capita income 
in the long run, and effectively tackle illiteracy and infant mortality at the same time.
The World Bank (1997) defines corruption as ‘the abuse of public office for private gain’, 
including bribery, threats and ‘kickbacks’. These are all aspects of rent-seeking behaviour that 
arise primarily because decisions over the allocation of resources are in the hands of politicians

and government oﬃcials. The existence of licences, permits, regulations, subsidies and, of course, 
taxes all oﬀer scope for corruption. Corruption not only leads to ineﬃciency – particularly the 
discouragement of investment – but can undermine the legitimacy of government itself. Where 
corruption is endemic, policy-making in other areas is less eﬀective and it makes it more diﬃcult 
for governments to enforce laws in areas such as taxation or control of environmental damage 
(see Elliott (1997), Tanzi (1998) and Bardhan (1997) for case studies on corruption).
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) now speciﬁes anti-corruption measures as one of the 
conditions for loan support. For example, the IMF recently got tough with the Kenyan govern-
ment, insisting ﬁrst on a ‘wealth declaration law’ that all government ministers and senior civil 
servants declare the full range of their assets and liabilities every year, and, second, on a weekly 
inspection by IMF oﬃcials in Washington of the Central Bank of Kenya’s balance sheet to prevent 
foreign aid being used for private gain.
Removing unnecessary regulations and bureaucracy, increasing transparency, and paying oﬃ-
cials higher salaries reduce the scope for corruption, but vested interests involved in corruption 
make the reform process more diﬃcult. The World Development Report 1997 (World Bank, 1997) 
outlines three essential ingredients for improving the capabilities of the state (and rooting out 
corruption):
1. There must be eﬀective rules and restraints to check public authority and prevent corruption. 
Independence of the judiciary is important, and an independent commission against corrup-
tion would be helpful.

2.	 Public officials should be appointed on merit, not on the basis of political patronage, and can 
be encouraged to perform effectively through a merit-based promotion system and adequate 
remuneration. Opening up competition in employment in the delivery of services is necessary 
to reduce the discretionary power of state officials to minimize rent-seeking behaviour, which 
is the basis of bribery and corruption.
3.	 Decision-making needs to be brought closer to the people so that they have more confidence 
in the state. All government programmes are likely to work better if there is democracy, if 
power is devolved, and if users are consulted.
Figure 9.2 shows the functions of the state in tabular form, distinguishing between the roles of 
addressing market failure and improving equity on the one hand, and the provision of minimal 
functions through to activist functions on the other, according to capability.
Countries with a low state capability should concentrate first on basic functions, such as the 
provision of pure public goods, macroeconomic stability and anti-poverty programmes. Going 
beyond these basic services are intermediate functions, such as the management of externalities, 
regulating monopoly, improving information and providing social insurance. Finally, states with a 
strong capability can take on more active functions, as mentioned above in the case of the Asian 
tigers, particularly promoting new markets through active industrial and financial policy.
The state also has a duty to reduce bureaucracy and regulation to allow markets to flour-
ish. According to a World Bank (2004) study of laws and regulations in 133 countries, the 
costs in time, effort and money in setting up businesses in developing countries are colossal 
compared with developed countries because of bureaucratic delays and institutional ineffi-
ciencies. In Indonesia, it takes 168 days to set up a business and 152 days in Brazil, but it takes 
only 2 days in New Zealand. In some developing countries, the average bureaucratic cost of 
setting up a business can be four times the average income per head; in developed countries 
it is as little as 1% of average income per head. The consequences of poor and inappropriate 
regulations are that business is discouraged; a higher proportion of businesses operates out-
side the law, so the tax base is lower and corruption is more widespread. It is estimated that 
excessive regulations, inadequate enforcement of contracts, corruption and crime reduce the 
sales of firms by at least 25%.

Failed states, conflict and violence
There are some 40–50 countries in the world, many in Africa, that hardly function at all, politic 
ally or economically, because their institutions and the rule of law have broken down. These are 
failed states, or what Paul Collier (2007) has coined fragile states caught in a conflict trap and 
prone to violence. Examples in recent years would be countries such as Somalia, Democratic 
Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Yemen, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Guinea, Chad, 
Haiti and many others. Within such countries, people are disenfranchised and trapped in poverty 
at the mercy of vicious networks of criminality, violence and drugs. In these countries, the state 
has effectively collapsed, the government has lost control and is unable to provide even the most 
basic services and protection for its people. Moreover, conflict and violence can spread from one 
failed state to another – witness the contagion of failed states that we see in the Middle East 
today. Failed states contain approximately 1.5 billion people or 20% of the world’s population. 
They account for 30% of people living on less than $1.90 a day, and poverty rates in these coun-
tries are over 20% higher than in other low-income countries
A major cause and characteristic of failed states is civil war, violence and the breakdown of secu-
rity. The World Bank’s World Development Report 2011 (World Bank, 2011) was subtitled Conflict, 
Security and Development, and Paul Collier, one of the world’s experts on failed states, addresses 
some of these issues in his book, Wars, Guns and Votes (2009). Thirty-nine countries have expe-
rienced civil wars since the year 2000, and the cost is huge. The World Bank estimates that civil 
 
conflict costs the average developing country approximately 30 years of growth of GDP. The total 
cost of Sri Lanka’s civil war between 1983 and 1996 was about $4 billion or twice the size of its GDP 
in 1996. Civil conflict not only affects GDP directly but also indirectly by reducing investment, 
raising inflation, and reducing government revenues and expenditures in fields such as education, 
health and other productive activities. At the same time, infrastructure is destroyed, human cap­
ital is lost, and tourism and trade can be badly affected, thus reducing foreign exchange earnings. 
Gupta et al. (2002) document these effects, taking 20 conflict-affected countries over the period 
1985–99. They look at variables three years before conflict started and three years after conflict, 
and also test the effect of conflict in a wider study of 45 countries (including countries not affected 
by conflict) using an index of conflict and terrorism compiled by International Country Risk 
Guide, and a separate index of conflict compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute. They estimate strong significant adverse impacts on GDP growth, inflation and tax rev-
enues, with the prospect of a substantial peace dividend once the conflict ends and security is 
restored. Collier (2007) reckons that ‘civil wars tend to reduce growth by 2.3 percent per year, so 
the typical seven-year war leaves a country around 15 percent poorer than it would have been’.
The World Bank (2011) writes: ‘the central aspect of conflict and failed states is absence of 
legitimate institutions that provide citizens with security, justice and jobs’. The lessons of experi-
ence that it draws are:
1.	 To make the reform of security and justice systems a priority.
2.	 To build inclusive institutions (see Chapter 8).
3.	 To try to deliver early results.
4.	 To recognize that the process of state-building can be a long one with interruptions on the way.
But reforms must be made. These would include security, recognizing the connection between 
the police and justice, supporting bottom-up links between the state and civil society, tackling 
corruption, creating jobs particularly for young men who often form the core of disaffected 
groups, and social improvements to give people hope.

Ghani and Lockhart (2008), in their powerful book, Fixing Failed States, outline ten key func-
tions that the state should perform if its citizens are to survive and thrive, avoiding conflict:
•
• To make laws, and to enforce the rule of law, to allow all sections of society to live in harmony.
•
• The control of violence.
•
• The appointment of uncorrupt administrators to oversee public bodies.
•
• The sound management of public finances.
•
• Investment in human capital.
•
• The creation of citizenship rights through social policy to ensure equal opportunities for all.
•
• The provision of infrastructure services.
•
• The creation and expansion of markets.
•
• The management of public assets, such as land, water rights and other ‘natural’ capital.
•
• Effective public borrowing.
If all these functions are performed well, a virtuous circle of growth and development is possible. 
If some of the functions are performed badly, a vicious circle can start, ultimately ending in the 
failure of the state and any prospect of sustained economic and social development. As the World 
Bank (2011) says: ‘low incomes, poverty, unemployment, income shocks, rapid urbanization, and 
inequality between groups all increase the risks of violence’. Violence is as important a factor as 
civil conflict in keeping countries poor. The World Bank has set up the Low-Income Countries 
Under Stress fund to help failed states, while the UK government’s intention is to spend one-half 
of its bilateral aid budget on 20 or more countries, mainly in Africa, where the state has virtually 
collapsed (see Case example 9.1 on Rwanda).
Development plans
In its World Development Report 1997, the World Bank (1997) does not address the role of devel-
opment planning, but almost all developing countries, whatever their political ideology, publish 
development plans.2 A development plan is an ideal way for a government to set out its devel-
opment objectives and demonstrate initiative in tackling the country’s development problems. 
 
A development plan can serve to stimulate effort throughout the country, and also act as a cata-
lyst for foreign investment and loans from international institutions.
Case example 9.1
Rwanda on the road to recovery
At the end of 1994, almost a million Rwandans were dead and nearly three mil-
lion were refugees, following years of decline and conflict capped by a cataclysmic 
geno­
cide. The UK was the first country to provide direct support to Rwanda to 
help rebuild state institutions, national infrastructure and people’s lives. As a re-
sult, schools and hospitals have been rebuilt, equal numbers of boys and girls are at 
school, and an effective tax system provides revenue for a growing national budget. 
Land ownership – an issue that helped fuel the genocide – is being addressed 
through practical reforms. Democracy has been boosted by a strengthened elect­
oral system. Rwanda is the first country in the world with a predominantly female 
parliament. Rwanda has a long way to go but it is rapidly leaving behind the status 
of ‘fragile state’.

As an example, the Tongan 6th Development Plan (1991–95) stated that:
The ultimate aim of government policy is to induce improvements in the standard of living of 
Tongans in an equitable manner with a view to protecting natural resources and preserving 
cultural assets – Government policy will also pursue an equitable distribution of public invest-
ment and services between rural and urban areas, and between the capital [city], islands and 
outer regions.
Four economic and social objectives were set out:
1.	 To achieve sustainable economic growth conducive to higher per capita income.
2.	 To achieve a more equitable distribution of income.
3.	 To generate more employment opportunities.
4.	 To restore and control external financial imbalances.
Depending on the politics of a country and its available expertise, a development plan will vary 
in its ambitiousness from a mere statement of aims to detailed calculations (and proposals for 
action) of the resources needed, and the amount of output that each sector of the economy must 
generate, in order to achieve a stipulated target rate of growth of output or per capita income. 
Anything more than a statement of aims inevitably involves some form of model-building, if only 
to delineate the relationship between sectors of the economy and between the key variables in 
the growth process.
Four basic types of model are typically used in development planning:
1.	 Macro- or aggregate models of the economy, which may either be of the simple Harrod–
Domar type (see Chapter 4) or of a more econometric nature, consisting of a series of equa-
tions that represent the basic structural relations in an economy between, say, factor inputs 
and product outputs, saving and income, imports and expenditure and so on.
2.	 Sector models, which isolate the major sectors of an economy and give the structural relations 
within each sector, and also specify the interrelationships between sectors, for example be-
tween agriculture and industry, between capital and consumer goods industries, and between 
the government and the rest of the economy.
3.	 Interindustry models, which show the transactions and interrelationships between producing 
sectors of an economy, normally in the form of an input–output table.
4.	 Models and techniques for project appraisal to decide on the allocation of resources between 
activities (see this textbook’s website, www.palgravehighered.com/Thirlwall-Econ-Of-Dev-10e).
Models such as these serve a twofold purpose. First, they enable planners to reach decisions on 
how to achieve specified goals. They highlight the strategic choices open to the policy-maker in the 
knowledge that not all desirable goals are achievable simultaneously. Only with an understand-
ing of the interrelationship between the different parts of the economy, and a knowledge of the 
parameters of the economic system, is it possible for meaningful and consistent policy decisions 
to be reached. Without detailed information on which to base planning (or what has been called 
‘planning without facts’), the case for decentralized decision-making becomes overwhelming.
Second, models of the type described above can perform an equally valuable function of 
en­
abling the future to be projected with a greater degree of certainty than would otherwise be 
possible, thereby providing some knowledge of what resources are likely to be available in relation 
to requirements within a stipulated planning period. Various types of model may be classified, 
therefore, according to whether they are required for policy or decision purposes or for projection 
270

D E V E L O P M E N T  P R O C E S S
and forecasting. The necessary constituents of a plan containing both types of model are a state-
ment of economic goals, a specification of policy instruments, an estimation of structural rela-
tionships, historical data, the recognition of exogenous variables, and, last but not least, a set of 
national accounts for national income and expenditure, foreign trade and even manpower to 
ensure consistency between demand and the supply of resources available.
The allocation of resources: the broad policy choices
Given the scarcity of resources in developing countries in relation to development needs, one 
of the central issues in development economics is the allocation of resources among competing 
ends. For most developing countries, the two major constraints on the growth of output are the 
ability to invest and the ability to import, and most theories of resource allocation and most pub-
lic investment criteria reflect this fact. A common starting point in the consideration of resource 
allocation is how to maximize the level or growth of output with the domestic resources available, 
and how to minimize the use of foreign exchange.
Apart from the decision of how much to invest, three broad types of allocation decision may 
be distinguished:
1.	 Which sectors to invest in.
2.	 Which projects should receive priority, given the factor endowments of a country and its de-
velopment goals.
3.	 Which combination of factors of production should be used to produce a given vector of 
goods and services, which will determine the technology of production.
While these decisions may look independent, in fact they are not. In practice, interdependence 
between decisions on output and decisions on technology is inevitable. Deciding which goods to 
produce will, to a certain extent, dictate factor proportions if technical coefficients are relatively 
fixed, and decisions about technology will influence the types of goods and services that are pro-
duced, insofar as factor proportions cannot be varied. Some goods and services are obviously 
more labour-intensive than others. The choice of technology will, in turn, be particularly influ-
enced by factor endowments and the price of factors of production, and by the relative valuation 
given to present versus future consumption and welfare.
Because of the interdependence between the choice of goods and the choice of technology, a 
country that decides to use relatively labour-intensive techniques within the framework of goods 
chosen may nonetheless have a greater capital intensity than another country using relatively 
capital-intensive techniques with a different mix of goods. When discussing resource allocation 
and the choice of techniques, a distinction needs to be made between investment criteria that 
relate to the pattern of output on the one hand, and the choice of technology to produce the 
given vector of outputs on the other.
Investment decisions of the micro-type outlined above will also be influenced to a certain 
degree by the nature of the development strategy intended – that is, by broader policy issues, 
such as whether emphasis is to be given to agriculture or industry, whether resources are to be 
used to build up complementary activities, or whether imbalances are to be deliberately cre-
ated in order to induce investment and influence decision-making, and whether emphasis is to 
be on static short-term efficiency in the allocation of resources or on laying the foundations for 
faster growth in the future. And, in an open economy, the potential clash between efficiency and 
growth also requires a consideration of the implications of adherence to different versions of the 
271
9  •  T H E  R O L E  O F  T H E  S TAT E  I N  E C O N O M I C  D E V E L O P M E N T
comparative cost doctrine. In short, the question of resource allocation between projects cannot 
be divorced from consideration of the wider policy issues of industry versus agriculture, balanced 
versus unbalanced growth, foreign trade strategy and so on. And influencing all these decisions 
will be the underlying objectives of the development strategy: whether the aim is to maximize 
current welfare or to maximize consumption at some future point in time.
The choice of development strategy itself will be subject to political, social and economic con-
straints. A particular strategy, for example, may conflict with the desired income distribution or 
other social objectives. Other strategies may involve political repercussions inimical to develop-
ment. One factor that cannot be ignored is the regional distribution of political power. Spatial 
considerations of this sort add a further dimension to the allocation problem. The pursuit of bal-
anced growth or massive investment in social overhead capital may imply a large public sector in 
the economy, which may not be politically possible. Certain development plans may antagonize 
foreign investors or multilateral aid-giving agencies, such that if the plans are carried out, foreign 
capital or ‘agency’ capital dries up. Bearing in mind these constraints, let us first consider some of 
the broader aspects of development strategy and briefly discuss development goals, before exam-
ining a number of specific investment criteria that have been recommended for determining the 
allocation of resources and the pattern of output.
Industry versus agriculture
The issue of the choice between industry and agriculture, and where the emphasis should lie, can 
be discussed very quickly because, as we saw in Chapter 5, the two sectors are very much comple-
mentary to each other. In practice, the fortunes of agriculture and industry are closely interwoven, 
in that the expansion of industry depends to a large extent on improvements in agricultural prod­
uctivity, and improvements in agricultural productivity depend on adequate supplies of industrial 
‘inputs’, including the provision of consumer goods acting as incentives to peasant farmers to 
increase the agricultural surplus. It is worth mentioning, however, that the emphasis on balance 
between industry and agriculture is of fairly recent origin. On the one hand, it represents a shift 
of emphasis away from the ‘modern’ view of an all-out drive for industrialization by develop-
ing countries, and on the other hand, it represents a reaction against the traditional doctrine of 
comparative cost advantage, which, when applied to many developing countries, may lead to the 
production of primary commodities and a pattern of trade that puts these countries at a relative 
development disadvantage (see Chapter 15).
The comparative cost doctrine
Whether the static comparative cost doctrine should be adhered to is itself a question of devel-
opment strategy, which is closely bound up with the goals of developing countries (that is, what 
they are trying to maximize), and with the controversy over whether trade should be looked at 
more from the point of view of the balance of payments than from that of the allocation of real 
resources. Assuming the full employment of resources, and that the price of a commodity reflects 
its opportunity cost (admittedly bold assumptions in any country), adherence to the compara-
tive cost doctrine will produce the optimum pattern of production and trade for a country (see 
Chapter 15). Efficiency will be maximized when no commodity is produced that could be imported 
at a lower cost, measured by the resources that would have to be sacrificed to produce it at home. 
272
F A C T O R S  I N  T H E  ­
D E V E L O P M E N T  P R O C E S S
In a free trade world, this would rule out the production of a wide range of industrial commodities 
in developing countries.
If the objective is faster economic growth, however, as opposed to static efficiency, the theory 
of growth suggests investment criteria that are quite different from those derived from the theory 
of comparative advantage. If growth depends on increases in investment, for example, it may not 
be wise to channel resources into activities that are too labour-intensive, where the income gener-
ated is all consumed and none is saved, or where there is no scope for increasing returns. Similarly, 
if growth is constrained by the balance of payments, it may be equally unwise to develop activities 
that produce goods with a low price and income elasticity of demand in world markets, such as 
primary commodities. A low price elasticity of demand can cause fluctuations in export earnings 
with shifts in supply, and cause the terms of trade to move adversely. A low income elasticity of 
demand will mean that, for any given growth of world income, countries producing these com-
modities will be put at a permanent balance of payments disadvantage compared with other 
countries producing goods with a higher income elasticity of demand (see Chapters 15 and 16).
The question ultimately boils down to one of the relative valuation of present versus future 
output and consumption (or welfare) – between consumption today and consumption tomor-
row. Efficiency in resource allocation will maximize present output and consumption from a given 
amount of resources, but may impair growth and future consumption. Focusing on growth may 
lower present welfare but provide greater output and welfare in the future.
Present versus future consumption
The choice between present and future consumption is the same as the choice between con-
sumption and investment in the present. How much investment should be undertaken in the pre-
sent depends on the time interval over which society wants to maximize consumption and what 
value it places on consumption in the future compared with consumption in the present – that is, 
on the rate at which it discounts future consumption gains. Time affects both the accumulation 
of consumption gains and the effect that discounting has. Investment should take place so as to 
maximize consumption over the planning period. The investment ratio that maximizes consump-
tion will vary according to the planning period, with and without discounting.
Let us illustrate this with a numerical example. Consider three different investment ratios – 0%, 
10% and 50% of national income – and three different planning periods – three years, six years 
and ten years. Further assume that the capital–output ratio is 2, and that, for simplicity, there is 
no depreciation and no discounting. Let the initial capital stock equal 200, producing 100 units of 
output. The time paths of output, consumption, investment and the capital stock for the three 
different investment strategies and three different planning horizons can now be shown, as in 
Table 9.2. Over the three-year planning period, the first policy of no investment maximizes con-
sumption. Over the six-year planning period, the second policy of a 10% investment ratio maxi-
mizes consumption, and over the ten-year planning period, the third policy of a 50% investment 
ratio maximizes consumption.
The calculations in Table 9.2, and the conclusions drawn from them about the time period 
over which consumption will be maximized, will be affected by discounting and the discount rate 
chosen, because the present value of future consumption gains becomes less and less the further 
into the future they accrue, and their value is also lower the higher the discount rate chosen. What 
we illustrate, then, is that the answer to the question of how much to invest depends crucially on 
the planning horizon taken and the discount rate chosen. The longer the planning horizon and the 
273
9  •  T H E  R O L E  O F  T H E  S TAT E  I N  E C O N O M I C  D E V E L O P M E N T
less the stream of future consumption benefits is discounted, the more investment there should 
be in the present. The shorter the planning horizon and the higher the discount rate, the less 
investment there will be.
We also illustrate that countries with low initial stocks of capital and low levels of consumption 
must invest heavily if high future living standards are to be attained. But to invest heavily, coun-
tries must take long planning horizons. One of the arguments for planning is, in fact, to lengthen 
the planning horizon beyond that chosen by individuals maximizing privately. Any finite planning 
horizon, however, only takes care of the people living within the planning period. To take account 
of generations living beyond the horizon, certain constraints must be built into the investment 
model such that, for example, the level of consumption at the end of the period should not be 
above a specified level, otherwise maximization of consumption within the horizon would mean 
consuming all income at the end of the horizon, leaving no saving for future investment and 
consumption.
Choice of techniques
In a planning framework, the valuation of present versus future welfare is also the central issue 
regarding the choice of technology – whether techniques should be capital- or labour-intensive. 
At first sight, it would seem sensible, in a labour-abundant economy, to use labour-intensive tech-
niques of production, and to encourage activities that use factors of production that are in abun-
dance. Doing so, however, may lead to a conflict between efficiency and growth; a clash between 
the maximization of present consumption and the level of consumption in the future. The problem 
is that if the wage rate is given, and invariant with respect to the technique of production, the more 
labour-intensive the technique, the less saving that is likely to be generated for future reinvestment. 
Specifically, if workers’ propensity to consume is higher than that of the owners of capital, the total 
surplus, and the surplus per unit of capital invested, left for reinvestment, will be smaller than if 
the technology were more capital-intensive. On the other hand, the more capital-intensive the

technology, the lower the level of consumption and employment in the present.3 In general, we 
reach the conclusion that the higher the valuation placed on raising the present level of employ-
ment and consumption as compared with future output, the more that labour-intensive techniques 
should be favoured. At the same time, the greater the valuation placed on future output in relation 
to present welfare, the more that capital-intensive methods of production should be favoured.
There is not only a potential conflict between employment and saving in the choice of tech-
niques, but also a conflict between employment and output. The conflict arises not in the util­
ization of existing equipment but in the choice of new techniques. Labour-intensive techniques 
of production may have higher capital–output ratios than more capital-intensive techniques. A 
simple example will illustrate the point. Assume a fixed amount of capital to be invested of £1,000. 
One technique of production could employ 100 units of labour with £1,000 of capital, but the 
capital–output ratio is 5. This would give a flow of output of 200 with the employment of 100 per-
sons. A second technique of production employs 50 units of labour but has a capital–output ratio 
of 4. This would give a flow of output of 250 with the employment of 50 persons. Thus, maximizing 
both the current level of employment and output are consistent only if the more labour-intensive 
techniques also have the lowest capital–output ratios. These issues are discussed fully in Chapter 6.
Balanced versus unbalanced growth
Another broad choice of development strategy is between so-called ‘balanced and unbalanced 
growth’. The term ‘balanced growth’ is used in many different senses, but the original exponents 
of the balanced growth doctrine had in mind the scale of investment necessary to overcome indi-
visibilities on both the supply and demand side of the development process (see, e.g., Rosenstein-
Rodan, 1943; Nurkse, 1953). Indivisibilities on the supply side refer to the ‘lumpiness’ of capital 
(especially social overhead capital), and the fact that only investment in a large number of activ­
ities simultaneously can take advantage of various external economies of scale. Indivisibilities on 
the demand side refer to the limitations imposed by the size of the market on the profitability, 
and hence feasibility, of economic activities. This was the original interpretation of the doctrine 
of balanced growth: that the large-scale expansion of activities or big push was necessary to over-
come divergences between the private and social returns to investment. The doctrine was later 
extended, however, to refer to the path of economic development and the pattern of investment 
necessary to keep the different sectors of the economy in balance, so that lack of development in 
one sector does not impede development in others; for example, the necessity to strike a balance 
between sectors such as agriculture and industry, between the capital goods and consumer goods 
industries, and between social capital and directly productive activities (see also Lewis, 1955).
On the demand side, the argument is akin to Adam Smith’s famous dictum that specialization, 
or the division of labour, is limited by the extent of the market, and that if the market is limited, 
certain activities may not be economically viable (see Chapter 4). If, however, several activities are 
established simultaneously, each could provide a market for the other’s products, so that activities 
that are not profitable when considered in isolation would become profitable when considered in 
the context of a large-scale development programme.
On the supply side, the argument for a ‘big push’ is related to the existence of external econ­
omies of scale, whereby the production function of one activity may be favourably altered by the 
existence of other activities (e.g. those in close proximity), so that the social return of an activity 
will exceed the private return. The way to eliminate this divergence is to make each activity part of 
an overall programme of investment expansion. Enterprises that are not, or do not appear to be, 
275

profitable in isolation become profitable when considered as part of an overall plan for industrial 
expansion embracing several activities.
A major criticism of the balanced growth doctrine, however, is that it fails to come to grips with 
one of the fundamental obstacles to development in developing countries, namely a shortage of 
resources of all kinds. Critics of balanced growth do not deny the importance of a large-scale invest-
ment programme and the expansion of complementary activities. Their argument is that in the 
absence of sufficient resources, especially capital, entrepreneurs and decision-makers, the striving for 
balanced growth may not provide sufficient stimulus to the spontaneous mobilization of resources or 
the inducement to invest, and will certainly not economize on decision-taking if planning is required.
One of the most provocative books ever written on development strategy is that by Hirschman 
(1958), whose argument is along the above lines. Hirschman was then the foremost exponent of 
the doctrine of unbalanced growth, and we must briefly consider his views as these are still rele­
vant today. The question he attempts to answer is this: Given a limited amount of investment 
resources and a series of proposed investment projects whose total cost exceeds the available 
resources, how do we pick out the projects that will make the greatest contribution to develop-
ment relative to their cost? And how should ‘contribution’ be measured?
Hirschman (1958) distinguishes two types of investment choices – substitution choices and 
postponement choices. Substitution choices are those that involve a decision as to whether pro-
ject A or B should be undertaken. Postponement choices are those that involve a decision as to 
the sequence of projects A and B – that is, which should precede the other. Hirschman is mainly 
concerned with postponement choices and how they are made. His fundamental thesis is that the 
question of priority must be resolved on the basis of a comparative appraisal of the strength with 
which progress in one area will induce progress in another. The efficient sequence of projects will 
necessarily vary from region to region and from country to country, depending on the nature of 
the obstacles to development, but the basic case for the approach remains the same – that is, to 
economize on decision-making. In Hirschman’s view, the real scarcity in developing countries is 
not the resources themselves but the means and ability to bring them into play. Preference should 
be given to that sequence of projects that maximizes induced decision-making.
Hirschman (1958) illustrates his argument by considering the relation between social capital (SC) 
and directly productive activities (DPA). The case in which SC precedes DPA he calls ‘development 
via excess capacity’, and the case in which DPA precedes SC he labels ‘development via shortages’.

Both sequences create inducements and pressures conducive to development; the question is: Which 
sequence should be adopted (if it is not possible to pursue a ‘balanced’ growth path) to produce DPA 
output at minimum cost in terms of inputs into both DPA and SC? The question can be made clearer 
with the aid of a diagram (see Figure 9.3).
If the total cost of DPA output is measured on the vertical axis, and the availability and cost of 
SC is measured on the horizontal axis, curves can be drawn (a, b, c) showing the cost of producing 
a given full capacity output of DPA from a given amount of investment in DPA, as a function of 
the availability of SC. The successive curves, a, b, c, represent diﬀerent levels of DPA output from 
successively higher investment in DPA. The curves are negatively sloped and convex to the origin 
because DPA costs will decrease the greater the availability of social capital, but there is a min-
curve a), and as SC increases, its impact on the cost of DPA output becomes less and less.
Now assume that the objective of the economy is to obtain increasing outputs of DPA with the 
minimum use of resources devoted to both DPA and SC. On each curve, a, b, c, the point where 
the sum of the coordinates is smallest will represent the most desirable combination of DPA and 
SC on this criterion. The line 0X connects the optimal points on the diﬀerent curves and this 
represents the most ‘eﬃcient’ expansion path, or ‘balanced’ growth path, between SC and DPA.
But suppose that ‘optimal’ amounts of SC and DPA cannot be expanded simultaneously to 
keep in balance with one another. On what criteria is that postponement choice made? One pos-
sibility is the sequence AA1BB2C, where the initial expansionary step is always taken by social capi-
tal. This sequence is called ‘development via excess capacity’. The other (opposite) possibility is 
the sequence AB1BC1C, where the initial expansionary step is taken by DPA. This sequence is called 
‘development via shortages’. According to Hirschman, the preference should go to the sequence of 
expansion that maximizes ‘induced decision-making’. It is diﬃcult to tell a priori which sequence 
this is likely to be. If SC is expanded, existing DPA becomes less costly, encouraging further DPA. 
If DPA is expanded ﬁrst, costs will rise but pressures will arise for SC facilities to be provided. Both 
sequences set up incentives and pressures and, ultimately, in Hirschman’s view, the sequence cho-
sen must depend on the relative strength of entrepreneurial motivations on the one hand, and 
on the response to public pressure of the authorities responsible for social capital on the other.
Hirschman applies the same criterion of ‘induced decision-making’ to the choice and sequence 
of projects within the directly productive sector. Here, inducements stem from interdependen-
cies between activities, or what Hirschman (1958) calls backward and forward linkage eﬀects. 
Backward linkages measure the proportion of an activity’s output that represents purchases from

other domestic activities. Forward linkages measure the proportion of an activity’s output that 
does not go to meet final demand but is used as an input into other activities. With knowledge of 
interindustry flows in an economy, with the help of an input–output table, it is possible to rank 
activities according to the magnitude of their combined linkage effects. Hirschman is suggesting 
that, within the directly productive sector, a useful development strategy would be to encour-
age those activities with the potentially highest combined linkages, because this will provide the 
greatest inducement and incentive to other activities to develop.
Unfortunately, one of the typical characteristics of developing countries is a lack of inter- 
dependence between activities. Primary product production has only limited backward linkages 
with other activities, while forward linkages, although potentially greater, also tend to be limited 
in practice. Agriculture’s demands on other sectors are minimal, and only a comparatively small 
fraction of total agricultural output in developing countries is processed domestically – most is 
exported. The fact that manufacturing activities possess greater backward and forward linkages, 
strengthening the cumulative nature of development, is another powerful argument for indus-
trialization. Hirschman advocates the expansion of industry through the transformation of semi-
manufactures into goods required for final demand, or what he calls ‘enclave import’ industries.
In general, Hirschman (1958) lays great stress on the role of imports in the development pro-
cess, seeing imports as part of the inducement mechanism. For not only can semi-manufactured 
imports be processed into goods for final demand, but final demand imports themselves can 
then be readily produced at home once the market has attained a certain size (or production 
threshold). If one of the major obstacles to development is a shortage of decision-makers, coupled 
with uncertainty and a limited market, the existence of imports provides conclusive proof that 
the market is there. As imports increase, so too do the chances that domestic production will one 
day be profitable. Hirschman criticizes developing countries for restricting imports prematurely, 
and argues that infant industry protection should only be given after imports have reached such 
a level as to guarantee domestic producers a market for their goods.
Investment criteria
Traditional micro-theory teaches that under perfect competition, resources will be optimally allo-
cated when each factor of production is employed up to the point where its marginal product 
is equal to its price, and that society’s output (welfare) will be maximized when the marginal 
products of factors are equated in all their uses. This is the so-called ‘marginal rule’ for resource 
allocation and implies ‘efficiency’, in the sense that a society’s total output of goods and services 
could not be increased by any redistribution of resources between activities because each factor 
of production is equally productive in existing activities. In static analysis, therefore, ‘efficiency’ in 
resource allocation implies maximizing the national product, which is achieved when the mar-
ginal products of factors are equated in their different uses.
If the application of the marginal rule leads to an efficient allocation of resources, what is the 
allocation ‘problem’ in developing countries? Why seek other criteria to decide on the allocation 
of resources? One good reason is that the assumptions of traditional micro-theory do not accord 
with the realities or aspirations of developing countries. Two major drawbacks of the application 
of the marginal rule may be cited. One is that the marginal rule is a static criterion, and as we have 
said before, it is by no means certain that the aim of developing countries is, or ought to be, the 
maximization of the present level of output, consumption or welfare. Second, traditional static the-
ory ignores many factors that may have a bearing on the social optimum allocation of resources. In 
278
F A C T O R S  I N  T H E  ­
D E V E L O P M E N T  P R O C E S S
countries characterized by fundamental structural disequilibria and extreme imperfections in the 
market, it cannot be assumed that the market prices of goods and factors of production reflect 
the social costs and benefits of production. The application of the marginal rule will only lead to a 
socially optimal allocation of resources in the absence of divergences between market prices and 
social costs and benefits, or if market prices are corrected to reflect social values.
Several factors can lead to divergences between market prices and the social valuation of goods 
and factors of production. First, if external economies and increasing returns are attached to some 
projects, their social value will exceed their private value, and the application of the marginal rule 
must make allowances for this, if output is to be maximized from a given endowment of factors.
Second, if perfect competition does not prevail in the product market, product prices will not 
reflect society’s valuation of those products, and market prices must somehow be adjusted to 
achieve a social optimum. Similarly, if perfect competition does not prevail in the factor market, 
the price of factors will not reflect their opportunity cost to society, so that employing factors up 
to the point where their marginal product equals their price will not produce a social optimum. 
Underemployed resources such as labour will be overvalued, and scarce resources such as cap­
ital and foreign exchange will be undervalued, and market prices must therefore be corrected to 
reflect the value of these resources to society.
Third, static analysis ignores the future structure of product and factor prices arising from the 
choice of projects in the present. An optimum resource allocation in the present may not pro-
duce an optimal allocation of resources in the future. The only way of coping with this difficulty is 
through what is called the programming approach to resource allocation, by which the reper-
cussions of one activity on others are explicitly considered and due allowance is made for time.
Finally, the application of the marginal rule can only lead to optimal resource allocation if 
income distribution is ‘optimal’ and remains unaffected by whatever programme is decided on. 
If a new pattern of resource allocation alters income distribution, output may be maximized but 
welfare diminished because of ‘undesirable’ changes in the distribution of income gains. To say any-
thing concrete on this score requires an explicit statement of societal objectives, or a social welfare 
function, if interpersonal comparisons of utility are to be avoided. Presumably, there might be a fair 
degree of consensus that an income distribution that leaves half the population unemployed and 
starving is ‘inferior’ to one that does not. Only the conditions for Pareto optimality would deny it 
(a situation is said to be Pareto optimal only if a change that benefits some does not harm others).
For all the above reasons, there has been a prolonged debate for many years over the most 
appropriate criterion for resource allocation in the light of the development obstacles of devel-
oping countries and their aspirations. The different criteria that have been suggested reflect, by 
and large, differences of opinion as to what developing countries ought to attempt to maximize, 
the broad choice being between present and future levels of output and consumption. Most of 
the criteria discussed by early writers in this field refer to the allocation of capital, reflecting the 
view of domestic saving as the primary scarce resource. Increasingly, however, attention has been 
paid to the effects of resource allocation decisions on the balance of payments, in recognition of 
foreign exchange as an equally scarce resource.
Summary
•
• In free-market economies, the market mechanism allocates resources among competing ends, 
but markets in developing countries have many imperfections that need correcting for a social 
optimum allocation of resources.

•
• Prices of goods and factors of production may not reflect their social benefit and social cost, 
respectively, because of positive and negative externalities. Markets may be incomplete or miss-
ing entirely. This provides a role for the state.
•
• The state has four key functions: to correct market imperfections; to provide public goods 
(such as health and education); to protect the vulnerable; and to provide an institutional en­
vironment in which markets can flourish.
•
• The state may also fail through corruption and rent-seeking behaviour. There are many ‘failed 
states’ in the world in which institutions and the rule of law have broken down.
•
• Many developing countries practise development planning, with various degrees of success.
•
• The central question facing all developing countries is how to allocate resources to maximize 
the level or growth of per capita output with the domestic resources available, and how to 
minimize the use of foreign exchange (which is a scarce resource).
•
• Apart from the decision of how much to invest, there are three broad types of allocation deci-
sions: which sectors to invest in, which projects should receive priority, and which combination 
of factors of production should be used, which will determine the technology of production.
•
• In addition, countries need to decide on the balance between agriculture and industry, the 
extent to which static comparative advantage is allowed to dictate production, the balance 
between present and future consumption, and whether growth should be ‘balanced’ (between 
sectors) or deliberately unbalanced.

Notes
1.  In many developed countries, the state is even more pervasive in terms of expenditure, although 
a much higher proportion represents social security transfer payments, not expenditure on real 
resources.
2.  Students should familiarize themselves with a plan for a country of their choosing.
3.  This conclusion depends on, among other things, the wage rate being invariant with respect to 
the technique of production. If the wage is higher the more capital-intensive the technique, this 
conclusion would have to be modified. For a discussion of this point, and other considerations that 
may lessen the conflict between employment and saving in the choice of techniques, see Chapter 6.
