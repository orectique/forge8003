SPEAKER 1
of theory, the theory is not a study. And, uh, for example, you know the classical economics and the traces back to more than 200 years. You know, it's not ideas. Some principle are there. But the form of the, uh to capture the phenomenon of the economic growth is changing all the time here, basically now. So in order to understand the relationship, uh, or the evolution, the nature and the characteristic of the change is very useful to actually put them together. Right? And when you have this electric, uh, electric covering all this issue and, uh and then the phenomenon you raise all the question being discussed is all nonstop making sense. All right, So, uh, so In that case, uh, perhaps, uh, I can ask you a question about, uh, if we can summarise, uh, all these, uh, the growth, the theory about the gross phenomenon. So what is the key? The observation we may have based on the this lecture? Yeah. So many theories. Right? Even in the amount of classical economy we can see, there's so many quite a few right school of thought. And, uh, so using a term you can summarise. And, uh, in fact, that summary can go all the way to neoclassical. And in theory, So why is that? And a any any idea? I think we can see right. You can see from their theory, and, uh, they are support their analysis, Basically. But also importantly, is about implication right through here, Basically. Now, any ideas of that? No. Let me tell you, one way of kind of a scoop thought is that, uh, it's the, uh, the optimistic view, right? Another one is what it is. Not the pessimistic about the growth prospect doesn't matter about, uh, about, uh, which state of development. So in the classical sense, for example, we have one who are those, uh, optimistic view. You know it, right? Who? Who is that? Yes, it's Alan Smith, right? Alan Smith. Why? Alan Smith's theory is one is the, uh is optimistic about the economic growth. Why is that? Because the growth is driven by a set of, uh, kind of, uh, changes, right? But based on the specialisation of the region of labour, that can lead to increasing return, right? So therefore, it's a rather optimistic in the way. But on the other hand, we have a tool, at least the two, the classical economy. They are rather pessimistic, right? So who are they called Mars, Right. And, uh, why is that? Because of population and food production and the population growth and the food production. If it is not being matched, then we have a problem, right? That problem in the lecture is defined, which is actually quite useful for today's, uh, a similar discussion that the imbalance between the growth of population and with the food supply is what is a, uh, so so-called low equilibrium trap? So many countries and the track there because there's a lot of population growth, but not matched by food production. All right, so so, uh, So ma is they are rather so not not hope. Unless, you know, we have a very measure for the adjustment to the population growth if you can materialise because of for a few reasons, right, if you remember the technology and, uh, the preventative measures are taken by people and, uh, but also the, uh the technology, the food production and all these things, right. But still, people believe that maybe in the long run is still relevant anyway. So there's another classical economist is also rather pessimistic. Who is that? David. David Ricardo, Right. This David Ricardo is a role of rather pessimistic. Why is that? Because, remember, there's a shark in the letter. Then there's a shark in the letter, right? So you can see the national income is divided into the three part right. The part is taken by a landlord in a form of rent. The part which actually is a top taken by the capitalists. Right. And also, there's a part of, uh, the wages. That wage is, uh, of course shared by the workers. So for him, it's the production is a subject for immediate to refer that division. That principle was taken up later on by the neoclassical economic right and the the new return. So therefore the, uh, neo to sustain the the production and also marginal cost per lot. Those are kind of the, uh di returns were made the production. You know, people are competing on a national income because there's not so much growth right there. So therefore, the the profit, the profit of the capitalist are being squeezed squeezed to the extent that reinvestment by the collapse right is actually limited. But re reinvest of a perfect is A is A is a capital accumulation, right? So if the perfect margin you squeeze because you have to pay high salary, right, because the of especially the division return to land, that is a very much very powerful method. Right, So by that, So you know, the wages have to be higher, because why, when you have a division return to that, we just have to be sorry. The price of agricultural has to be higher, right? So But in that case, you have to offer higher salaries to to the workers. So that's, uh, you know, for the market. So the capital reinvestment that being limited in that sense so again since I, you know, we know it's so important for the capital accumulation right to generate, you know, the secondary industry to generate effect. If you talk about the embody technology, you can also see that the capital accumulation holds the key for that change. But so therefore, you know, very hard is rather in a way, right. So the new let's move quickly to the new classical economic, which is, uh, you know, solar model, etcetera that model again, you can see the similar thing being character from a class which is OK Wow is a dim. This time is not diminish to capital. It's not a diminution to land is the diminution return to work. So in a sense, honestly can be like technology like a taste, preferences and etcetera. We can see when the income increases per cap income increases, then you can see the capital. Cumulation also increases, right, so that's the ratio of capital to labour. Remember that it is capital to labour ratio holds the key in this case right, because while increasing that one, we can divide that one into two parts. The first part is the capital labour increase for develop for development is so important. Right? Because of what? Because you you need the capital. Remember how right growth of, uh, uh, rate target for 5% and capital operation is a three. That you need a 50% of saving to meet the requirement of capital. That example already given. And today, of course, you know is, uh is the same thing. So capital investment is so important. But for each country, when you reach a certain state, capital to labour ratio becomes so high in a way that capital is subject to de This is the the classical economy. In a sense, it rather P because But at the same time, you can see that theory also predict the convergence. So in the lecture, why convergence? What do we mean by convergence? The convergence is between later covers and all advance why they are converting because the the richer you get the higher capital labour ratio. That one is the fact the return of capital. So you have a less growth right. The growth will become less. That's the rich country. Well, for developing country capital, labour ratio is very low. So therefore capital is not subject to the return so that you can see the little power can catch up more quickly. This is called a convergence, right? But to a large extent, convergence didn't happen and let it continue to progress in a way. And then this is the idea of the so called neuron endogenous theory. So that something happened, something happened which should prevent the capital deviation the capital from happening. Which is why, because we have a higher act delivery, you will remember that that can be honestly be equal in this letter several times and use that problem. It actually I The focus is very simple, but it is actually very simple. On the left hand side equation is the capital output ratio. Remember, K over one total capital stop divided by total GDP. Right, the GDP and that is it. We know it lower the better, right? Because the lower means that in producing a unit of output you use less capital. So capital efficiency is improved. Our national, that one the similar one, right? We we one So the lower the better. But on the right hand of equation, the first term is the capital labour ratio I ask you to remember capital per capital term. So if that increase a lot of way of development, that will lead to what? The increase of capital of the ratio right, which is so good, which is not good because of the reflecting diminution return to capital, they can actually drive some growth. Right? So that is the situation for which, uh, you know, the convergency. But however, on the red as an equation, there is one condition which is YL over one or the other way around you, I understand, is the cap is out over labour. That's the per capita output, right? If the per capita output can increase if the output can increase, which is the productivity that can prevent that can prevent the, uh, the capital, which is to prevent capital of ratio to increase as a result of a capital labour ratio increase. Right. So because it's an offside by the improvement of the productivity, that's the whole idea about in group theory. Something in what sense and human capital either is the public policy in terms of, uh, investing in human capital infrastructure and, uh, or many other things, that institution, they all play very important role for doing that. So now for after this lecture, the reason why growth company is useful In fact, in the in the in the week to we actually try to discuss, uh, kind of, uh, yeah, a bit early. But, uh, that is also capture. Those are the key things. Right? So, uh but let me come back to tackle labour ratio just for a moment. Why, That is important. The tackle well, is that basically, we're talking about the productivity right labour productivity, for example, but now capital labour ratio. And some say, especially for developing countries, when you increase capital labour ratio, that can lead to auto changes, right industrial development income and the standard of living. So it will be very useful. But su suppose if the capital increase at the at at the same speed as the labour increase, that means the capital labour remain the same Same proportional increase. Right? So what do we mean by that? If the grocery are the same, the ratio are the same, right? But capital are increasing. It match the labour increase. So what we mean what is the phenomenon of that? That's by definition this is called the capital winning. All right, you remain the same. But if the capital grows with the capital, the speed is higher than the growth of the labour force. Right? So you can see the ratio is actually increasing. This phenomenon is called capital. Deepening capital deepening means that the ratio is actually increasing the capital speed. The accumulation of capital are more than the accumulation of labour law. So in that case, you can see the capital deepening is happening. And for in the development, capital deepening is so important, right? So because it go beyond the labour force, you have a more capital. But that is one thing, on the other hand, in the early phase of development is actually very useful because the development need the capital accumulation and the capital accumulation breaks all the boldness, right in terms of, uh, growth and the development. So in that case, is it it's so important for for the, uh, P going through, right, So is that clear? But if not, you can see the identity in the letter. It's just identity, the same thing. But it's a very powerful message to capture those relationship. And, uh another relationship is the grows account, which is already mentioned. And this is so useful in a way, because we can capture right, apart from the contribution of a factor of production, labour and capital, we have now, you know, the TAP right as being discussed. And the TFP is also so crucial because in today's seminar we are talking about the middle income trap, right? The middle income trap is also very much we can use that framework to analyse this. All right, so that comes later. So another theory we have introduced in the in this lecture is the Hino of example already given that several times IOP but also the, uh the reason why the the the model is powerful is that you know, we can have this. Uh, it's a golden age, right? The actual growth rate is equal to the warranty of growth rate, which is a more or less as a balance growth and, uh, with the so called natural growth rate. Right. So now we have identified using that we have identified one condition. That condition is the GN, which is the growth. Natural growth rate is actually higher than the B growth rate, and that's a typical phenomenon for developing. Right. So, uh, remember, that is, uh how do you define natural growth? Natural growth rate by definition, is also called the potential growth rate, right. Very useful. Even now, when people are talking about, uh, the growth of China, the growth of Japan, the growth of many countries, that very one, the key inside is to see how the potential growth is if the potential growth is very low. No matter how you know you, you try to boost the growth. It won't help unless you have a massive government policy, you know, which can be distortionary and uh so the the the potential growth rate are due to two factors. I remember.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, that's right.

SPEAKER 1
Basically, it's just the two things, right. It's the growth of population, growth of labour force for the growth of productivity. When you have a very low on both, the potential growth is very low in a way. But when you have, uh, especially with with the molecule potentially will have a massive population growth right? Labour growth growth are high and, uh so therefore, the potential growth is tend to be high and, uh, Of course, productivity is another matter. So with this potential growth rate higher than the warranty growth rate, you can see war grow is more balance. Right? So therefore, if you have this, uh, situation for as many developing country, what you do that is that what you require is not being matched by the resources. All is not being matched now, for example, you need the most. But you do have that. So what do you do? You know, borrowing and all these things. So that would be very distortionary thing. But however, in the text we also have a three solutions right to deal with the situation where the, uh the, uh the grocery the potential grocery is higher than the war Grocery. If you can remember that three, you basically can, uh, you can pass this test increase that excellent. The need to increase the saving. When you try to increase the saving, you can see that the vertical line right, moving, moving right the right way so that you can narrow that again. Very good. Secondly, corporation Sorry.

SPEAKER 3
Population control.

SPEAKER 1
That's right. The second one is the population control right. When you have a population control as you mentioned, growth in population is, uh is one of the GN, right? Like growth. So you lower right, You lower than the horizontal line. OK? The gap between GN and the GW very narrow down C, which is a crucial national secretary for excellent. The third one is that you have this, uh, you have the angle that curve, right? That angle is being determined that a small angle is being determined critically. Why you try to remember right by the, uh for operation. The reason why we said is the lower, the better and the lower the better means that the the the system can rather efficiently mobilise the resource in this ball to go. So therefore you can see the efficiency of the capital can be improved. So by doing so, you can say, you know, you match you. You you narrow down the gap between G and GW. Right? So this one is very much related to so called the structural work banking financial, which is the, uh we have a lecture on that one. You know, financial, financial reform is very much related. How the system, you know, can utilise the more efficiently these people are watching the If you grow up, you will probably not advise the people to invest because it's not a good indication about your financial or ma, uh, market or or banking sector. But if it is continuous to be stable or actually be coming down, well, you can see the potential. Something doesn't right in the system to improve the efficiency of nuclear capital. So why not? And this is another term, Uh uh, Come back to that one is about, uh, the marginal, uh, return to to capital basically return of that investment. And, uh, so you can see very good. Three measures can be taken by narrow gap. So which is the, uh, again, let me focus on the the final one, which is the the four. The structure change the structure changes and to allow basically So, for example, the market again, we have a lecture on that one later on state versus the market. And, uh, when you have this, uh, the market system, for example, running very well, then you can improve the so called allocated efficiency. Right. When you try to improve that one, the resources tend to be more efficiently utilised That's of course, we deliver right the good economic outcome. So that's the another the the rather powerful the message of that one. The, uh there's a yeah, we introduced not the capital widening, but also capital deepening right capital deepening. Can have, uh, extra. You know, the investment for for the, uh for the for the kind of structure changes income. The productivity is all very much related. That and, uh but also remember, at the early phase of development, that increase in capital is not subject the subject to diminution return. Right. So that's why uh so many multinational companies and and firms in the develop that try to invest, uh, in the form of a F theory investment in, uh in a developing country Because why? Because the developing country capital labour ratio is very low and capital is not subject to the union. Return and capital return tend to be higher. Of course they want to to make that investment and for developing country, they also welcome FBI because of the land of capital. And so that's the story for all East Asia. And, uh, you know, Japan. Uh uh, asean, uh, you know, the Asian uh, for for tigers and ASEAN is the same, you know, it's a boost the regional growth and the D track. Perhaps, uh, I think after the global economy overcome the covid the negative impact and, uh, and overcome the certain barriers of the new caused by the the geopolitical, uh, consideration, then this kind of re will happen to the benefit of everyone. But anyway, so that's one and another. One story is about the convergence, right? The convergence is being predicted in a neuro classical sense. Because remember, now everyone knows that the diminution and, uh for for the higher income countries. And, uh, but convergence when people try to is the very convenient way of doing that one is to use the initial per cap income and to estimate that growth, right, If the initial growth per capita income that coefficient of beta is being negative, that means what the the poor, uh, base of the country has. They tend to have a high growth, right, Negative. So, however, for many for many developing countries, so sorry for many actual research, See that that a coefficient, the beta, the estimation is not a negative, actually positive. So That means that you know the Neal Classical growth theory. The prediction may not be right in a way that means the convergence didn't happen in a way. But, however, when the researchers added other variable added O other variables like infrastructure like education, the human capital investment and that the initial initial, uh, initial uh uh coefficient estimation and current from a quality connected wow. So that means that the convergence of a certain condition right to review and that condition is that we call this a conditional convergence and those condition is very much related to the role of government. You know, the modernised infrastructure, human capital, all these institution report. They all help when you make that investment. So look at those countries like China, for example, massive infrastructure development, right. And, uh, the beneficial effect is to be not so much captured by the actual investment in those infrastructure. In fact, many companies actually incur a tremendous loss effected by the local government as well. But however you can see there is a massive positive when you build the infrastructure right, the private companies, entrepreneurs, they all value a lot because of the you know, those are sophisticated infrastructure facilitate their business activity. That can be part of the conditional convergence. So I So now it makes sense now, right? That make it makes sense. Because, like the infrastructure investment become crucial because that can lead to the, uh, the later armour to catch up. OP Does that make sense? Why countries are borrowing money to put into infrastructure development because also potential ne of positive action resulting from that one. So economy and grow So, you know to So that's actually empirical, uh, study to show the that of beta I changed from a, uh, to negative. So therefore you can see the poor. You have the higher growth later on for you, but under certain conditions, that condition is very much related to what we have, uh, you know, uh, talking about in this letter about the role of the government, right? We talk about that one in another lecture in the region of the market by introducing a few, uh, concept the, uh the positive and, uh, all the convergence between those prices, But that comes later. But right now, you can just think about that, uh, in the gross accounting, uh, framework about those, uh, the importance of, uh, the rule of government. Right. It basically overcome those, uh, those, uh, bottlenecks, uh, to growth. Is that clear? Yeah, exactly. It is very popular, And, uh, but, uh, if you can work out those kind of a relationship and it's OK, so final, uh, summary of our le is one is that we have this, uh, quite powerful message in terms of, uh, applying the growing framework to capture through production function, approach to capture relationship between the input of the fact labour capital, TFP and output, which is so useful in a way, it's a powerful. It's a handy. And it's, uh, we can use in the right to use the actual data to test those, uh, hypotheses as just to summarise. And, uh, what is the limitation? What is the limitation of the theory? Also those with the protection? Uh uh function. Approach? Yes. If you remember or listen to the letter or going through the lecture notes. You know, those framework explain only. No. Sorry. It still left the 40% of the gross phenomenon and explain, uh, 40% is not a law. That means there's a There's a again. There's a a large part, quite a fairly large part of, uh, of, uh, explanation that we can explore, even though the framework then I think the conclusion is that the, uh, history method, this is my country's history, their evolution of their institution, their culture. And, uh and, uh, those, uh, value. Those are societal development. History matters. And, uh, this is the, uh Well, when you have this applied to those gross accounting, you basically mirror classical one. Assume everyone is the same. Uh, you know, this is the old rational being, but in fact, they are not. And that's, uh, again what we already mentioned, uh, in institution last week. So very handy to understand the power of institution in determining of gross performance of a particular. So again, you know, increasingly, last week, I think some student mentioned about, uh, you know, institution analysis. It's a wrong way. In a way, it's not a it's not a it's not a some kind of, uh, you know, you can precisely, you know, quantify all those things, but nevertheless insufficient. They are such an important role. And if we we can't understand that role, we can't explain very properly about, uh, about the the growth phenomenon. So which is the, uh, which is our concern, right. We we try to explain, uh, why group performances are different across. So we try to, you know, uh, as I mentioned earlier on the the the framework is very useful, especially for students in economic. Right. When you apply those framework, you can estimate like a text did right about cross country differences in terms of their TAP. Right? The model can tell you in a lot of precise way right, and it's very useful. But if you don't understand, what are the TFP right? We can't explain and especially we call a draw and, uh, orive the important rle policy implementation from that. So in that case, you know, we do have to understand you know what's actually going on. So again, history matter in that regard, because institutional changes are historical process and institution. The pattern of gene being demonstrated through that pattern of, uh the so-called, the policy patterns and the the incremental change of institution. So understand the nature of that institution is very important for us to understand the whole of the phenomenon of economic. So I stop here The, uh, in terms of software is that clear? I hope it's, uh it's OK. And, uh, try to try to, uh, try to not memorising the way to understand all those fundamentals. And once you have this, uh, connect that, it makes much more sense. And also, I emphasise again, you know, this lecture growth number four is, uh, basically the whole semester, the 12 letters OP. And if we can see that in this paper, the example I just gave you last week when we have you mentioned just now we can connect right in the TFP. And when we have a migration, we know that is the phenomenon of the so-called resource shift effect. And that's by definition again is part of DFP. That's related right when we talk about the financial liberalisation, financial market reform and liberalisation, when we talk about why the real interest rate is actually is so important holds the key for the flourish of, uh of F of the entrepreneurship that we know the connection And, uh, when we have open trade and, uh, just to trade and FDR, we know how that fit in in the growth, Right? So almost like, uh, all the subject right? Be covered in this lecture throughout the semester. We can actually apply interface labour understanding the Is that clear? Yeah. Gradually. Gradually, you can see, uh, convince you more and more, you know, we can see and how that is important now. So, uh, any question is still confusing, or is it rather understandable? At least some kind of a basic ideas. All right, but I also I made the growth economic growth in the we have student from CBE, right? Yeah. So, uh, thank you for coming over a lot of people in two places to travel, but I will be able to distance that. So very good. So, girls, I used to be at a, uh a CV E. You know, teaching for the semester, for it can be two semesters. We two hours that my So therefore, if you really come and say a lot of connection gradually. But growth is very simple. The idea is very simple. The way you apply in fact, the textbook or data the table. You know, this, uh, this will be very useful. We have used to have a very, very great scholar, Steven, Uh, Star Wars from he passed away. The, uh We we living figures are growth. Of course. We have a, you know, small model. You know, we have, uh, the solo. Everyone talked about the solo model, right. But, uh, in 1952 solo developed his own model. And we have here the great scholar also develop similar setting in, uh, So in the literature, we call this, uh, you know, sort of small model. And, uh, but for most cases, people tend to forget about the so the contribution. That's a use. Yes, it is.

SPEAKER 3
I think we discuss about the condition of the GDP. Theory. I think we are now moving, uh, on the direction of some movement of GDP. I think whether if you don't have about the issue, But I think some, uh, some scholars already talked about it. Uh, I just want to know. What do you think about that? Uh I mean, uh, do we need to, uh, shift our thinking from GDP to beyond GDP measure. And yeah, remember in that one we have on the

SPEAKER 1
goal of the development, right? You can see the sun is also going through over time, right? GDP is a predominantly important. Uh, you know, GDP and GDU will have growth in the GDP. But increasingly, people find that. So what's the purpose of economic development when we get the GDP become a bigger the larger and larger and suddenly you look at the people's quality, whether they are still happy and not so The statistic analysis is no, there is not a positive correlation between the GDP and and happiness of the people. And you question your hope that you raise the question about, uh, whether GDP doesn't matter. However, I think there are two dimension that the, uh uh number one is that growth is still very important for developing fact. Without growth, without GDP without income, you know, very difficult to carry out in a very conducive way about the structure changes leading towards higher standard, very difficult. So therefore, it is important for all the goal of the society. Probably it won't depend on DVB a lot that is, perhaps you refer to more advance. So, uh, I think in Monash uh, NG I, those professor from North America and Europe, some schools now actually emerging about, uh the, uh the economics of It's not an economic right. It people, whether eventually where the the true welfare improvement is not to be fact purely by the income increase of income but also by the quality of life. Now, for example, when we address the, uh the, uh the the the pollution, the environmental concern. But even the ecological disease of those concern right is impact on us, because those are negative and quality of life people in health and etcetera. But modern technology again have I was really over the head? It's about those, uh, the, uh the, uh the, uh, again, you know, the increase increasing phenomenon of the loneliness, Uh, how come And, uh, so people feel more lonely now, but with all this modern technology which can connect people so well, right? But people feel this is the one kind of a paradoxical thing, but therefore the quality of life, all the housing, societal development of the track is that economic is, uh, of course, we cannot explain. Uh, try to explain everything from economic. There's also the social right and, uh, ecological and other measure added to as well so eventually I think with the use of big data. Those a I? I think it is. Uh, there's a good chance for us to again, you know, human versus biology. Good chance to improve further the standard V the wealth of the But also there's a chance to actually compromise. So to answer your question and, uh, of course, some country, right, the left foot, right. And, uh, you know, they have to. They they they want to emphasise those are happening people even at very low for that. But see, that's the way to go. So perhaps those society can be successful again to look at the people's face when you travel the look at the Long Street and see their faces are there all the time or they are trying to, you know, become more depressing. So, uh, it's not. Of course, there's a lot of things about, uh, the government policy as well, right? Because when the GDP when the P cannot possibly enlarge, the government will be in the law to do the things to overcome those income, equal deterioration of the environment, the environment of climate change, and all these things right, and they can actually do it. We have a lecture talking about the relationship between the, uh, government and the market a bit later on. But again, I think your question is it beyond And, uh, so keep thinking of those questions, right? So what's the purpose of of increasing now, when you add the ecological dimension to it and people realise no, even people know some question about the maximisation, those, uh, principles, uh, utility maximisation, property activation, consume and consume. But we don't really to see the downside of those. And how come you know the, uh the finite the supply of resources can sustain those, uh, those maximisation drive continuously. That's why people, uh, calculate this is about 10 years ago when people calculate there are 1.4 billion people in China to consume on the protected, uh, of a key resources equivalent to the United States at that time. Guess what is the conclusion of that? The conclusion of that is that we need three words and have that Anyway, those are the the the the the things. So, uh, that is, uh, yeah, we do have this and, uh, with a finite, uh, again, you know, you can have a modern technology you extract. You know, those, uh, hydrogens and other also from sea and air. Maybe not, You know, the solar and and the win. So it can be, uh, a solution. And, uh, but the society adjustment, you know, the green is a zero, not zero, right? The green is all part of that one. I think that one has a very important Yeah, and, uh, very importantly, is the people's consciousness. Whether people is aware what that what we are aware of, that it is very important. What we have is, uh, the awareness of those, uh, those important issue beyond GB P etcetera. Then I think is, uh, we can perform some kind of, uh, consensus. And that consensus can influence the way that we can grow it Also influence the way that the market functions and, uh, into, uh, uh, kind of lead towards a better future, but very, very important question. OK, so thank you for raising that one now. So And do we have a question from our online student? There was 15 of them. Two question. I say OK, Yeah, that's ok. I feel OK. Yeah. All right. So no question. Online and uh uh. Let's go through this. The, uh, the similar topic right now. As you know, from now on, similar topic matches with the, uh with the with a similar, uh uh, discussion. So, uh, I'm sorry, I can match that one. So, uh, we're discussing the the middle income, you know, and, uh, remember the, uh, in fact, in today's, uh, uh, seminar, we can have this, uh, three C, the low income middle income and higher income. And we can identify the drivers for country from a lower income group, you know, progressing towards the middle income and further to higher income. But we can also identify the risk each state associated with, uh, with the transition over time. And there's a typical phenomenon that no, is that so many countries when they actually overcome the initial the bottleneck of the initial development and, uh, raising their capital and, uh, income from low income to middle income. Everything seems to be very far right in terms of all the development. And suddenly the economy no longer it loses the dynamism and not a small number, it quite small, but it is a very significant phenomenon. And, uh, so that should be defined as the middle and that phenomenon we can actually deal with using or applying the framework we have just learned from, Like for, uh, uh, the growth of content. And, uh, with all these conditional convergence, those kind of idea is all right in discussing that, either. So let's do that. Yeah. Yeah. Now the question which is basically the extension of electoral for right, we have just covered. And how do we define the middle income trap? What are the facts about a middle income trap? Why do countries fall into the middle income trap and how to avoid it? They are very kind of a key concerns, right? In discussing those phenomena again, keep in mind about what we have just discussed about the growth, right. The middle income trap is the phenomenon of a rapid growing economy, Stig at the middle income level and feeding into a graduate into the ranks of high income country. So middle income trap is a situation for middle income countries where they are not able to move up to the higher income status due to the operation of several adverse factors. Faculty nor can be one human lack of human capital, government capability, institutional factors and global external environment. So all these things can be part of that one. But very important that is the falling one, that this is the phenomenon. Capture. You know, the key features of this phenomenon. The middle income trap is largely the result of a country's inability to continue the process of moving from a low value added to high value added industry. The advantage of a low cost labour, which is the as we know it right, you know, to attract FD I. And, uh, the imitation of a foreign technology can disappear when middle income or upper middle income levels are reached. The because when you have a low cost of labour and the cost of labour is a good advantage, right, because of the cost of production, can be low. That's 11 of the motivation, you know, for FD I to come to invest in that one. But when you have a higher per capita income like you reach the more than $10,000 you tend to lose those advantage. Right? So, uh, again no, you know people come, investors will come and it's not so much to, uh, to take advantage of the low cost of production. But you have to think about something else in a way. So that's one thing. Imitation, uh, is the of a foreign technology is the, uh is also a typical phenomenon associated with with a low income country, right, because when you have a low income country, you have a lack of the so called proper institution right? Intellectual property rights protection? No, when you have a very low. So that's why you can see Japan in the 1950 even in the sixties. Japan C the technology right from the West and in fact, to benefit the Japanese economy enormously later on. And Taiwan Taiwan also, you know, just a copy in a way and using those technology, know how and turn into production of certain goods right to their advantage. But increasingly, when they reach, uh, middle income or higher income, very difficult because institutional changes that requirement and, uh, prevent firms or individual. You know you for stealing or copying other things, so that's an advantage. Also disappear. Now what's left is connected to your own inner force of of growth, right innovation based on the human capital, right? Based on the, uh, you know, the learning that we see those kind of things on the good infrastructure development and, uh, good opinion centre and the environment to attract the talent, you know, from all of the places that come to your country to live and to work those kind of things, right. And, uh, but it also you lose that, uh, if you don't put that in place, you can see So this is the key thing. Pro. The process of, uh, moving from a low value added to a higher value added. Then what do you need using the gross accounting we have just learned, right? Using the gross accounting, you know, capital will continue to be very important, even though perhaps those countries. Now, you said maybe at the brink of, uh, of, uh, of this, you know, the stage of development, which where you have, uh, a higher capital labour ratio and that tend to tend to subject to the capital. But not yet. Not quite, But it's a It's a beginning to do that. That perhaps also translated into the lower rat of capital investment. So therefore, I have less motivation for people The FD I to come to your country back without that investment. We know the technology, right? The programme Everything will be even the motivation for somehow to improve the human capital is also Laing. No. So you know it's not a very much in demand. But when you compare with the early phase of development where you have a massive investment, massive inflow of foreign capital, right, you can see the demand of human scale. I want to go to school or training and then to be all to be qualified right to enter the labour force. And, uh but those disappear right? Or or or kind of gradually here. So people will become a less, uh uh motivation to So So those who prevent those, uh, structure changes continuously progress the world producing into high value. Previously, we based the value based on the low cost of labour. Right, The production, everything else being look after taken care by the foreign firm, the multinational firm except assembly. You use the cheap, cheap labour, right? Very low cost of labour. I have a little G. You basically, you know, qualify to do the job But however, those are the higher end of those industrial, you know, the value being controlled by foreign firm. Right. But we also to break that, uh, the bottom neck. You know, you have to find a way, right, Human capital and R and B. Right? And, uh, those things become important. And also the This is so the indigenous technology. Right? And you have to nurture that one. And I think China is one example used to be all controlled by FDR massively FD I operating all over the places. Sudden demand, especially in our zone, gradually into RC and all over the country and, uh, in additional firms are are trying hard, you know, to to to to to cash out in a way. But now you can see the technology in, in many area start matching the most advanced technology in the world. Right? So those kind of a learning curve and, uh, but again, human capital, you know, infrastructure, uh, market institution and the institution, including the protection of intellectual property, right, and used to be nothing there. You know, people come to Beijing, right to buy on the street, you can buy the, uh, the CD or DVD and, uh, with a couple of dollars, which is the which is the late the movie ladies. And here you pay $30 to watch that movie. But you can get that anywhere. Suddenly I say it all disappeared. The interesting right, All disappear. The parents say, Oh, God. Why is that? Because the the system actually changing the way you have indigenous you need. If you don't have that law the way, how come you can the domestic and indigenous innovators the entrepreneur you come So therefore, gravity institutional changes. You know where, uh, we provided the protection. So the, uh, the innovative activities a large, uh, in the system. So it is a typical example to show that and, uh, again So but, uh, you need a certain things, right? But now you are in this position, all right. We can We can have the same hour for this guy you are in a position to discuss. Let me give you the more example before we do. Right? So 24 no. 16 of them 24 out of 125 countries globally have been at a middle income stage continuously since 1980 87. 16 of them have been stuck at a middle income state for at least 50 years. Nine in Latin America, Brazil, Argentina and others. Three in Asia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Do we have a student come from Malaysia? No, I was, uh, travelling, Uh, in the 19 nineties, Uh, is my way to To to China and by Malaysia Airline. And then when I was arriving in the airport when the taxi took me to, uh, to the downtown, uh, city, I was so impressed. I think that is actually this is another Japan very sophisticated road and the building, the infrastructure and et cetera. But you can't actually say that it is a so you will reach at the state. No problem. But I get further up. No. So that's so Why is that? And the remaining three in Africa, South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia and Middle East, Jordan and Turkey. Those countries also. But in contrast to that one, it is a successful country in Asia. Japan takes 23 years, Korea, 32 Singapore. More or less. They break that one, you know, to the higher income countries status, right. They managed to do that. One small number, but offered enormous licence for the later. Especially for those countries you know, falls into the trap. There's a data you can look at the middle income, uh, things. And this one is the, uh, 1960 per capita income relative to the US and 1 2008 relative income to the US. So you can see this. A lot of countries stuck in the in the in the in the middle there. So let me move quickly. And, uh, why so they suffer from a low investment? That's one of the things. Now you are in a position, right? We just discussed the capital investment we just discussed from a classical ami emphasising division of labour. But importantly, increasing return is, uh, related to capital accumulation. Right? Uh uh, Ricardo. David Ricardo Also emphasising, very importantly, the capital accumulation. But also pointed out, uh, rather concerned, right is about, uh, about, uh, the, uh the dim return to capital and how that affects the, uh, the profit and how that affects the, uh, the reinvestment based on the profit. And, uh, so that's, uh, still applied. Ok, you are now in the position to apply that one slow growth in secondary industry again, You have to think about, uh, the last, uh, lecture when we talk about the corridors law, right when we talk about, uh the, uh the, uh yeah, the the importance of a a secondary industry manufacturing development. The growth of that one is correlated with three things, right. You can apply that one too. So, I repeat, is the the productivity of the manufacturer AD productivity outside the manufacturer, And, uh so it's all related to the secondary industry. So you have to continue to enlarge that one some country, very quickly when they reach the level of development. The secondary industry shrinks so quickly in a way, because the the service sector picking up but the service sector, on average, their productivity level is lower than the, uh, the secondary industry. Secondary industry is the higher the productivity level than the primary industry. Agriculture. So that's why the structural changes is so important. Let me ask you one quick question. So what is the the determinant of the structure changes over time is determined by what forgot already in productivity,

SPEAKER 2
agriculture, sector. So people, whenever we want to grow.

SPEAKER 4
Our growth is targeted, uh, the industries which have productivity, we tend to switch to that.

SPEAKER 1
I know. I know that my question is the determinant of that change. That's right. It's the income. A of demand. Remember Income analysis. That question appears in every single exam every year. Still have students who fail to answer that question. OK, so please remember that one. So when you come to the secondary industry is lacking of that development, right? That's a part of that one. So in limited industrial diversification and the structural change, secondly, they just suffer from a macroeconomic, political and social instability. Either is, you know, hyper inflation, the debt crisis we mentioned several times. But we will continue to discuss that one later on. Income inequality is another One have a poor labour market condition and the lack of investment in human capital and infrastructure and, uh, market distortion again comes later. We government institution and the corruption. So those things you can apply the framework we have just learned in analysing so we can have a more discuss. Now the question is how to avoid, You know, this is the constantly innovate, right upgrade production risk, productivity and climate, the value chain and the tutorial question. And, uh, we can, I think, is there No. But anyway, we can see for tutorial question right. Incentive to invest and develop a new and more advanced machinery production processes and the product of R and D and the deep structural changes. And, uh, But on this point, it's also very important for the, uh, for international trade and investment. So continuously at this stage to to do it as a trade regional economic corporation, for example, can help to overcome those, uh, bottleneck and, uh, public investment. We already mentioned all this here. This is the conditional convergence right infrastructure and educate, uh, human capital or functional market system. Adequate resources, which is backed by market comparing institution. This one again, we mentioned that one already. And, uh uh, the last one is a controversial. That means that how this country and that state to apply the industrial policy OK, the the the reason why it's a controversial Is it because there can be very application of or implementation of those policy can be very distortionary, and then we can. The topic will pick up when we talk about international trade, right? And, uh, it's a typical phenomenon. Now, as we mentioned in lecture one about those self sufficiency, uh, as a result of the covid uh uh, pandemic crisis, right? Everyone wants to produce the goods they need. And, uh, but whether that is the right approach and that's a part of your the writing for your for your for your for your essay. Sorry for the, uh, for the assignment so you can see interesting, right, low income. The drivers have been listed there. I won't repeat and moving towards the, uh, the middle income and, uh, but also to higher income. But also the risk there in the in the in, the in the lower box, right. And the institution inequality is a part of that one. And the factor accumulation, the wage rises. You know, the cost of, uh, of, uh, of a productions are rising. So in if in fact, if you have a, uh, lower, uh, speed of adjustment in terms of structural changes against the background of rising wages, you can see the mismatch there. Rising wages has to accompany being accompanied by the rising human capital, which are very suitable in producing the higher value added right. So if you don't have a structural changes, you don't have opportunity moving towards producing a higher value added. What's the use of that? You know the human capital, so people have a less motivation to do so in a way. So you have to overcome that one. Higher education, technology and infrastructure again the at high income level. Now the world is facing, you know, those of population ageing and the physical sustainability you can see. You know, So many developed developed countries now have heavily on debt. The physical stability in the long run is a real issue in Australia, The government debt is almost like a trillion dollars Australian dollars and, uh, projected to to pay pay down and pay back in, uh, in 10 years time. So though in many other countries, US in particular, right, you know, 33 $34 trillion debt mesh with, uh, 3334 GDP, you know, 100% basically so inequality case of US and the excessive leverage. That means that when the economy structure moving from the secondary towards the tertiary industry, but within the tertiary industry More focus on the financial, uh uh, development. So those financial development that have a tendency and like the real economy when you have this, uh, you know, investment and match with what development in the in that financial sector is very high leverage, very high leverage all every every, uh, levels in a way. So again as we know it, you know, this can easily trigger the financial crisis. As we observed in the past few couple of decades, Very often previously, it is less so, but now it's so often to incur that one. This is a high income. So again, in today's summary, we mentioned about a low equilibrium trap, right? That's basically being defined by the the imbalances between the population growth with the supply of food. Right? And so you have a you trapped there, trapped can lead. The view is a circle low income, low saving, low investment low, uh, low, uh, machinery investment. So they have a low less chance to improve the productivity further. So those kind of things, right? And, uh, now, today we have, uh, discussed the phenomenon of a middle income right. But in fact, we can also talk about Foresee the future about high income, and it's not a trap there. But it's tremendous challenges for the the higher income country right now to continue to to improve right against the all the background of, uh, the population ageing income inequality and the physical sustainability again. So almost like every single level of, uh, of, uh, of a development. And we can see those kind of, uh, you know, the the, uh, the constraints on their growth. Right. And, uh so but But let's focus on the middle income trap for our, you know, case study discussion. Right now, let me finish so we can come to the discussion right questions earlier for TFP. But let's focus more on the, uh, on the questions. Yes. Please repeat the excessive leverage part.

SPEAKER 2
OK, excessively excessive leverage in the financial in the financial

SPEAKER 1
market. The li is actually is that the pattern of those investment is a very different from the the investment in the real economy. In the financial field, the banking like a you know, global financial crisis. You know why that happened? Why did that happen? 11 $1 of a real G. You have a 60 or $70 of a of a leverage. So that's the excessive. It's not right, because so so much is subject to the potential as this occurred in 2000, right? And in fact, people will see that the delivery now have been built up again. And, uh, again, this is some kind of a crisis, but financial crisis is down the track. And so so much vulnerability there in the field. Yeah, that's excessive. Be very demonstrated by the the rich. More because their sector secondary industry manufacture is a relative small less. The US manufacturing is actually very small. Less than 80% that 70 to 80% is in the financial, the service sector, but within that service sector financial. So that demonstrated the kind of investment we have. Exactly. Good. Yeah, thanks. Yes.

SPEAKER 2
So those are all generalisations, of course, But as a general statement is, the as you move See you.

SPEAKER 1
Well, TFTFDX, that's right. So that's actually good observation going through from a low to middle to higher the input of fact of production that labour and the capital will play, uh, somehow less important role the technology. Remember we mentioned about this producing the high value value product that they were driven by so many factors, right? Innovation in character. So they are part of the TFP. Not a question that when we reached a very high stage of development, we still care about the T. You know that actually back to the previous question about, uh, Kal something, you know, beyond the so if that is the case for the rich country, you know, probably less motivated. But again, competitions are there, As you can see, the the war, the trade war between, uh, the US and China and the competition out there and, uh, to some extent that very hot. So II, I believe that, uh, the TNT continue to be very important. But again, back to the capital is not just a capital capital. Can be a so called capital. Uh oh. They embodied the technology. I mean, when you make a new investment that those investments are the equipment, it's not just the they involve the new technology. So in that sense, it's also important when you add the labour cost increasingly, because of the, uh, the human impact. So therefore you can see the, uh you know, the labour force, the chronic labour in a way. And for all of sorry, thank you for reading that I think the very very related to we are talking about the capital labour and TFP right? And increasingly remember, when we see capital of capital labour ratio increase not necessarily lead to the increase of capital of ratio. But the condition precondition of that one is to to get the productivity right and that productivity, right over time, that the fundamental determinant of economic growth is a shifting from a physical or the or the tangible thing to the intangible thing. That's very significant. Used to be. You have all these labour, capital, mineral resources and all the things. But now you know the kind of things, right? All these. Uh, so that's the article we sent to you through model. And it was really is by, uh, by, uh by, uh, Roman and, uh, and Charles Jones. And, uh, about ideas. Yes, population. And, uh, when I was 4 a.m. in the time. And, uh, so the idea become important. And, uh so where, you know, we talk about the big idea. Uh, we call millions of little idea, but importantly, I think because of accumulation. So those are stage the accumulation of a huge impact enormously compared with other countries or level of development for those, uh, countries is capable, you know, in producing the new ideas, those new ideas can be an important part of generating the further growth, but not just for but for the global economy. Even though in this article I just mentioned about the new ideas, ideas and, uh, and the institution population. So in this, uh, article towards the end, the author actually using China as perhaps you can also apply the one to India apply for Indonesia and many other countries. We have a big population. This idea is a simple That means that you have, the more probability you will produce the pilot and those talent, you have more probability to produce a new idea. So he was a very simple calculation in this, uh, article. The calculation that is, uh, you know, those ideas generated through those very large big population, uh, using China as an example can produce that idea powerful enough to sustain the world economy. Growth continues. Wow. Brilliant. So that's back to your question, right? So again, you know, when you have a reach, that high level of the idea, those intangibles will be as the drivers for further growth Again, I have this a i of environment, And, uh, so we I think probably, you know, we can make all breakthrough in terms of the house for production. In that case, the TF. Yes, To answer your question can continue to be important, because that will be. And perhaps that productivity is driven by by the robot, right in robot automation rather than the humans. Right? So in a way. And, uh, so the productivity increases the enormously. The government were in a position to test the robot, right? To use the learning to help the people. What do we do as a human big question? What is the future requirement will be impactful. So again, when John was saying that his grandchildren will be able not to work very hard, you know, they will be able to enjoy the leisure and the art. And, uh, you know, the the things that you want to do and because what, Because we're happy. The productivity level high enough to those kind of, uh attitude. So that's why I know this. Yes, again, back to question in develop technology, discussing the full full days working days, or perhaps three working days and, uh, eventually perhaps, uh, you minimise the working hours. So what we do, we enjoy life, right? They do the things we like history, art and, uh, and and really the quality. Right. So is all very long, given the speed of, uh, those technology. Oh, yes, it is.

SPEAKER 2
We still got to say why. Why the contribution of land? Also, I feel like there's a fault that natural is a model of the world, but, um, very much, but quite over content, Um, the natural resources where which we somehow ignore and eliminate the con.

SPEAKER 1
Yeah. So the question actually moving from, uh, the, uh, T to, uh uh uh uh Well, we we we can

SPEAKER 2
We can clearly measure our capital. Well, why we somehow eliminate these?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, No. So all can be included recently, and, uh, we all can be included to resources energy, for example. You have some have specification of including the so that part, I somehow have to capture all of those capital. Cut the B and B energy. And, uh so this is a one technical. So previously when I did my magic fund So which,

SPEAKER 2
like, be more or less focused on the industrial industry part, which is, like, some and related to to cation or labour, um, or lack of participation. So it seems like the fact the plan, which doesn't affect the the industrialization too much and can Cadillac was that before So which only by by only first to the bottom?

SPEAKER 1
Yeah, that's OK. The normal production function. You can just continue to run that one. But if if you focus more on the, uh, on the agricultural production land, of course must be there. You can, but the standard access. That's OK. Any other question? OK, I think Let's, uh, sorry, because, uh, took much of the time in talking through. Let's have a Let's have a small group of discussion bamboo here, So just talk about maybe see the using the 15 minutes then we have about this time. I like to hear your view and, uh, to to test the understanding about All right, So our online students and, uh so here you can help with organising the same topic. How many? So you can have one group discussion and perhaps if you are If you are you you can write in the chat any any question. But we like you one of you, or at least maybe two to present later on. Ok, thanks.

SPEAKER 5
Yeah, Thank you. So I will set up a breakout room for you and we will give you, like, 15 minutes for discussion. And later on, please send one or two representatives to share your idea with our face to face students as well. So the topic is about the middle income job for all right, I just create the breakout room. Please join the room for free, OK?

SPEAKER 2
And the for all our participants, please join the breakout

SPEAKER 5
room.

SPEAKER 2
All three of you are. I think that's it. Ok, so we can, uh, please stop recording.

SPEAKER 1
We can resume later on the middle Middle income. The question is that no two question is the TF.

SPEAKER 2
It's a question of all middle income.

SPEAKER 1
Applying the framework of the middle income. Just be fast so you can apply it here again. No problem. But her focus on the new prime I can avoid

SPEAKER 2
it What's that? Yeah, like that. The are you soon? OK, OK, so that the strong just just try usually Ok, you know. Thank you. Mhm Thanks so much. Um and so the Yes. Awesome. No, it is the one. Yeah. OK, discrimination. OK, so that's that's what business. Thank Mr I'm not sure. So Yeah, it's It's just I think nothing. The allergist, right. Same. Yeah, OK, that discount. Yeah, I was like So you can do you have negotiation? Stupid Chief. She was so no, no subject. You see, I just the city this emotion so much And what I see if it's in here that time, we are time. And so the intent, right? I think the house it would be be she says to have to No, thank you, I guess. And in Scotland point that So he's, uh he's 75%. So on the that vehicle, it is time. Thank just Yes, fine. That a car more than we that hard. You also like, uh uh the Big 10 for yes, but nothing more. Yeah, Policy. No more Want to change? Um, again, this is, um, some schools, right? The ST you change the ok uh, like, stop this and to the west, you know? Are they so more like? Sure. OK, got it. Oh God. So how then? The one second. So I wanna breast OK, Travel. That's what you mean You should have It's forces ok of the what? All this say what she needs. I that and what's it like? Clo the force organisation. OK, innovation. OK, why don't you get, like, obviously what is in the Yeah 100 more? Give me more range. Is that yes. Ski? I'm not, you know, she comes to you Have the I finished that we have to I OK, I also one sister where you see, I just just come. Yeah, I as well for me and stuff like that. I tell you, I I mean the people. Yeah, because lot of, for instance, from the yeah to take with Oh, we we do. You can listen to the show when you show me you Maybe we give the give the chance to the

SPEAKER 1
online student to speak first. They're still discussing this.

SPEAKER 2
Oh, yeah, let me finish job. Yeah, so I but all right, so, uh, I think

SPEAKER 1
that an online group is, uh So, uh, that's three,

SPEAKER 2
but yeah. Just learn from that. Oh, I it I already assumed the recording, so Yeah,

SPEAKER 1
it's great. Uh, sorry to they haven't really, uh, haven't haven't get back yet. In that case, maybe we can start with with Yeah, So they they continue their discussion. So let's get back to, uh, the presentation. The part. So, uh, all right, So, uh, maybe start from your group. You have a gossip? Ah, kind of a summary, but especially in our time.

SPEAKER 6
00, we we we we we started from the Constitution, Of course. So we we talk about property rights, uh, protection or or patents protection like that. Um, so more or less we, we we and then we moved to to value added industry. So let's say some of the some of the countries say Japan or Korea that they're really good at doing doing, doing, doing doing I got no idea of the industries that they're in the vantage, but they're more or less focused on the value added part. They they put more in they they they invest in more funds there. Um, but, uh I mean, I come up with this idea. So So let's say, um because II I took Singapore as the example. So Singapore used to to to be one of the poorest, the country more Southeast Asia. But after Lee Kuan Yew took over of the Labour Action Party, is that called the same? Mm. They they they they try to develop the, uh they try to put a lot of more a lot more on, um, on tourism or tertiary industry. But right now that I've known that they converted. And then they transformed the industry into like like the oil refining oil processing industry. That's they built the artificial islands. What? They what the governments, uh, built the artificial islands for So it seems like, perhaps due to the pandemic mm. The tourism, which is not solid and firm for for this kind of vulnerable, uh uh. Countries say Singapore. But they take they they take they they they take full advantage of the the location of Singapore. It's the it's It's on the midwife from from Indian Ocean to Pacific Ocean, right at the end of, um, Morocco Strait. So I mean, yeah. What? What what else? What else?

SPEAKER 2
Where? Yeah, Actually, we also discuss mainly about the value added

SPEAKER 7
sector that these middle income countries need to focus on. But at the same time, those countries need to like, develop their own human capital, like improving the education, instil people with the knowledge and know how so they can, uh, use the modern technology that the, uh the, uh the employer needs So And at the same time, we also discuss about the institution of those countries like to improve the transparency and corruption. For example, if you want to manufacture the let's, say, textile or automobile, you need the the input of raw material from maybe different countries. But if your if your custom or your taxation department is involved in corruption and like, uh, they obstruct your the import of those products, so the process of production is not going to get smooth. So this also hamper the development, and it will put the country in more tribe into the middle income tribe. Thank you.

SPEAKER 1
Thank you so much. So So we have an online to show presented.

SPEAKER 5
So is there any representative you would like to present from our online group? You may just unload yourself and turn on your video.

SPEAKER 8
I mean, I can do it if no one else wants to.

SPEAKER 1
Very good. It is.

SPEAKER 8
OK, well, OK. Um we had a really, um, big discussion on, um, sort of, uh, like around investment. Essentially. And so we spoke about the causes being, um, for the middle income being a low investment into education infrastructure. Um, but then higher spending into maybe projects that don't really meet the mark or, um, too high savings. Um, you know, that don't really then result in the investment that's needed. Um, and then also the other side, which is more the social side of things which was conflict. Um um, or political instability or macroeconomic instability. Um, and I don't remember who it was, but gave a really good example that Indonesia and how, um, they were on track to become our upper middle income status. I think it's free. Um, but then after the pandemic, they returned to the lower income, um, middle status and have been unable to go back because that was a macroeconomic shock. Um, for the economy, um, then and other examples that we spoke about were Brazil and China, um, again, countries that, um in a sense. Haven't had a lot of real income rises like it's not gone down, but it's not risen. Um, over the past two years, and then we spoke about our sort of solutions being, um, to improve property rights and ownership to, um, increase investment in infrastructure and in building human capital. So, um, in, um, education essentially and then more technology and research and development expenditure and then, um, incentivizing innovation through, uh, government policies. Um, So essentially, we said that the middle income trap occurs because, um, the sort of secondary industry, um, yeah. Experiences are slow growth due to a low investment, low technology, low human capital. And then you solve that by investing in those areas.

SPEAKER 1
All right. Very good. Thank you. Uh, anyone else from, uh, from online group? Is there any other representatives? Isha? Yeah.

SPEAKER 5
Thank you. Ya Very good position. Any other students from online would like to share your idea.

SPEAKER 1
All right. OK. Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
So thank you. Thank you.

SPEAKER 9
Uh, so we discuss as we discuss, uh, the mm why countries fall into middle income trap. So the one is the most of the countries, like the middle income trap countries really, he, uh, rely heavily on low income, low cost labour and resource extraction industries. So the limited opportunities for investments and diminution returns impact on that and governance, for example, like corruption and inefficiencies in institutions. It also reduces the productivity growth and discourage investments. And we discuss about how failure to invest the research and development Mm, and lack of innovations and lack of welfare systems. And also the failures, uh, or the weaknesses in education policy and brain drain the educated people, they leave the country and go work in developed countries. So it impact on lack of innovations and, yeah, brain drain, and, uh, and then, uh, the Yeah, So the, uh Then we discuss what kind of policy lessons that, uh, the last question. What kind of policy lessons that we can get to avoid the middle income trap. So diversifying the economic, economic sources and structural reforms, welfare policies and education on to promote the skill training to improve our productivity. And, um uh, to promote more innovations and entrepreneurship and upgrading infrastructure and human capital and focus on sustainable and environmental policies, uh, and expanding the global market, uh, in in terms of trading. Uh, anything to add.

SPEAKER 4
Expanding the global market is one thing, because we know that, uh, it should be more export oriented, and exports cannot be easily expanded. So, uh, there should be more, uh, because of the higher wage and competitiveness. So whenever we are trying to expand the global market, we should also, uh, think about diversification a lot so that we can be very competitive in the global field as well, so that will earn us more foreign exchange. So, uh, this is very important that we have good policies to support, that our export oriented industries can go to the global market.

SPEAKER 1
That's an interesting observation. The middle level income that stage diversification.
