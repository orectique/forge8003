A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM THE 
AUTHORS
The economic and social development of poor countries and redu­
cing divisions in the world economy between rich and poor are two of 
the greatest challenges facing mankind. Vast diﬀerences in income and 
wealth between countries and peoples are not only morally indefensible 
but also pose a grave threat to peace and stability in the world.
John Maynard Keynes, the great English economist, once described 
what drew him to economics; he said, it was ‘its intellectual rigour com-
bined with its potentiality for good’. He treated the subject of econom-
ics as a moral science, the purpose of which is to understand economic 
behaviour and thereby be able design policies to make the world a 
more civilized place in which to live. It is this ‘potentiality for good’ that 
attracts so many of today’s top economists to development economics.
We have written this textbook on the economics of development so 
that students can apply their knowledge of economics to the plight of 
poor developing countries in the hope that they will better understand 
the divided world in which we live and think about issues of develop-
ment in whatever capacity they may subsequently work.
We have been teaching and practising development economics for 
many years and have encountered thousands of students in diﬀerent parts 
of the world and from diﬀerent countries, many of whom have gone on to 
work in the development ﬁeld – as employees in international institutions 
and nongovernmental organizations concerned with economic and social 
development, or as teachers and researchers in poor countries. If new generations of students study-
ing development economics are inspired to do the same, this volume will have achieved its purpose.
We hope you will enjoy the book, and that when you reach the end, you will feel that the study of the 
economics of development has enriched your experience as an economist and as a citizen of the world.
Wherever you live, we wish you good luck in your studies.
Anthony Thirlwall and Penélope Pacheco-López

PREFACE
The first edition of this book was published in 1972 and was entitled Growth and Development: 
with Special Reference to Developing Economies. After eight editions, in 2011, the title of the ninth 
edition was changed to Economics of Development: Theory and Evidence to reflect more accurately 
the contents of the book, which elaborates the theory of economic development, combined 
with empirical evidence on the functioning of developing countries in the world economy with 
respect to the important mainsprings of growth and development, such as capital formation, 
technical progress, institutions, national and international finance, trade, and particularly export 
performance. 
This new edition of the book, now jointly with Dr Penélope Pacheco-López, who has 
worked in many international economic organizations, gives the opportunity to substantially 
revise the content of the book, to update statistics, and rewrite chapters to include new theor­
etical ideas and institutional material in order to improve the exposition to aid students and 
teachers alike.
But the purpose of the book remains the same: to introduce students to the exciting and 
challenging subject of development economics, which draws on several branches of economics 
in order to elucidate and understand the development diﬃculties facing the economies of the 
world’s poor developing countries. This does not mean that the book provides a recipe or blue-
print for development: far from it. There can be no general recipes of this nature, and even if there 
were, they would have to include more than economic ingredients.
The book combines description and analysis, with an emphasis on the elaboration of simple 
and useful theoretical economic models for an understanding of the issues that comprise the 
subject matter of development economics. We make no apology for the use of conventional eco-
nomic theory. We concur with Theodore Schultz (1980), Nobel Prize-winning economist, who has 
said of development economics:
This branch of economics has suﬀered from several intellectual mistakes. The major mistake 
has been the presumption that standard economic theory is inadequate for understanding 
low income countries and that a separate economic theory is needed. Models developed for 
this purpose were widely acclaimed until it became evident that they were at best intellectual 
curiosities. The reaction of some economists was to turn to cultural and social explanations 
for the alleged poor economic performance of low income countries. Quite understandably, 
cultural and behavioral scholars are uneasy about this use of their studies. Fortunately, the 
intellectual tide has begun to turn. Increasing numbers of economists have come to realize 
that standard economic theory is just as applicable to the scarcity problems that confront low 
income countries as to the corresponding problems of high income countries.
P R E F A C E

This is not to say, of course, that all standard theory is useful and relevant for an understanding 
of the development process; in particular, the relevance of static equilibrium theory may be ques-
tioned. Nor is it possible to ignore non-economic factors in the growth and development process. 
The fact is, however, that the desire for material improvement in developing countries is very strong, 
and, in the ﬁnal analysis, growth and development must be considered an economic process, in the 
important practical sense that it is unlikely to proceed very far in the absence of an increase in the 
quantity and quality of the resources available for production. The book lays particular emphasis on 
the economic obstacles to development and the economic means by which developing countries 
may raise their rate of growth of output and living standards in order to reduce poverty.
For those new to the book, or for those using the ninth edition, we outline the main contents 
of each chapter and the changes introduced into this tenth edition.
Part I Development and underdevelopment comprises four major chapters that provide a 
basis for understanding the nature of poverty and underdevelopment in low-income countries, 
and the theories of economic growth and development that have been put forward over time. 
This part constitutes important background for the rest of the book.
Chapter 1 addresses the subject of development economics, the meaning of development and 
the challenge of development economics. The globalization and interdependence of the world 
economy is emphasized, and there is discussion of the call for a new international order, including 
the new Sustainable Development Goals, agreed in 2015.
Chapter 2 portrays the magnitude of the development gap between rich and poor coun-
tries in the world economy and discusses the measurement of poverty, including the Human 
Development Index (HDI) of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Multidimensional 
Poverty Index (MPI) of the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative. There is also a new 
section on randomized control trials (RCTs) for understanding the best way to reduce poverty. 
There is a discussion of the World Bank’s approach to tackling poverty based on the ideas of 
empowering the poor and extending their capabilities, as discussed in its World Development 
Report 2000/2001. New research is also reviewed on whether the global and international distribu-
tion of income is widening or narrowing. 
Chapter 3 outlines the characteristics of underdevelopment and gives quantitative evidence 
of various dimensions of the development gap with respect to employment and unemployment, 
hunger and the distribution of income within countries. The major characteristics of underdevel-
opment identiﬁed include the dominance of low-productivity agriculture and lack of industrial­
ization, low levels of capital accumulation, rapid population growth, an export trade dominated 
by primary products, the ‘curse of natural resources’ and weak governance and institutions. These 
topics are discussed more fully in later chapters. The process of structural change is also addressed, 
as is the notion of industrialization as the engine of growth.
Chapter 4 introduces students to various economic growth theories. There are sections on clas-
sical growth theory (Adam Smith, Malthus, Ricardo and Marx), the Harrod–Domar growth model, 
neoclassical growth theory, and the ‘new’ endogenous growth theory that now dominates the liter-
ature on the applied economics of growth, with its stress on the importance of physical and human 
capital formation and research and development eﬀort as the prime determinants of growth. Many 
empirical studies are surveyed, with regard to the production function approach to understanding 
the growth process and the macrodeterminants of growth approach using ‘new’ growth theory. 
There is also discussion of the work of Hausmann, Rodrik and others on growth accelerations, and 
the concept of ‘growth diagnostics’ and binding constraints on growth. If you ﬁnd the technical 
details too diﬃcult, you should proceed straight to Chapter 5, but you will be missing a lot.
P R E F A C E

Part II Factors in the development process contains five chapters: the role of agriculture 
and surplus labour in developing countries; the role of capital accumulation and technical pro-
gress for growth; a new chapter on human capital – education, gender, nutrition and health; 
the importance of institutions conducive to development; and the role of the state in economic 
development. 
Chapter 5 deals with the diﬀerent contributions that agriculture makes to the development 
process, one of which is a source of cheap labour for industry. Particular attention is paid to the 
inﬂuential Lewis model of economic development with unlimited supplies of labour. There is 
explicit treatment, following on from Lewis, of the interaction and complementarity between 
agriculture and industry, with a number of interesting insights into the importance of demand 
expansion from agriculture as a stimulus to industrial growth and of achieving an equilibrium 
terms of trade between the two sectors. There is also a discussion of barriers to raising agricultural 
productivity, highlighted by the World Bank’s World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for 
Development. There is an Appendix on how markets function in the rural agricultural sector, and 
how the land, labour and credit markets interlock, based on uncertainty of agricultural output 
and the risk aversion of agents.
Chapter 6 explores the role of capital accumulation and technical progress in the development 
process. The choice of appropriate techniques of production is also explored, and the potential 
conﬂicts involved in moving towards the use of more labour-intensive techniques – between 
employment and output and between employment and saving. The role played by multinational 
corporations in dictating technological choice is also examined.
Chapter 7 is a new chapter on the role of education, women, nutrition and health in the devel-
opment process. An educated, skilled and healthy workforce of men and women is vital in the 
production process to absorb new technology and for working efficiency.
Chapter 8 discusses the role of institutions in the development process. The importance of 
property rights and the rule of law is particularly emphasized, and the various institutions for 
regulating markets and providing social insurance. The important work of Rodrik on democracy 
is reviewed, and also the pioneering work of Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson on the relation-
ship between institutional development in colonized countries in the past and institutions today, 
and the debate on the importance of institutions versus geography in explaining diﬀerences in 
economic development.
Chapter 9 explores the role of the state in economic development and its role in resource 
allocation compared to reliance on the market mechanism. Market imperfections, market failure 
and corruption are highlighted, as are the limited capabilities of the state, drawing on the exten-
sive analysis contained in the World Bank’s World Development Report 1997. Some of the broader 
issues of development strategy are also considered, including the case for planning. There is a 
revised section on failed states, conflict and violence.
Part III The perpetuation of underdevelopment comprises three chapters that focus on 
­
factors that can perpetuate underdevelopment, including poverty itself (causing a vicious circle), 
rapid population growth and the impact of development on the environment.
Chapter 10 explores dualism and Myrdal’s concept of the process of circular and cumula-
tive causation, and describes the mechanisms by which economic divisions between regions and 
between countries tend to be perpetuated and widened. It includes the early ­
centre–­
periphery 
models of Prebisch and Kaldor, together with discussion of the new economic geography 
­
pioneered by Krugman. The views of Marxist writers, including Emmanuel’s model of unequal 
exchange, are also presented.
P R E F A C E

Chapter 11 discusses population and development and attempts to evaluate the debate on 
whether population expansion is a growth-inducing or growth-retarding force. The costs and 
bene­
fits of population growth are examined, together with the different ways an optimum popu-
lation may be defined. The facts on population growth are clearly outlined, with a discussion of 
the determinants of fertility.
Chapter 12, written by our colleague Professor Iain Fraser, discusses how environmental issues 
may be incorporated into social cost–beneﬁt analysis, and the new and important concept of sus-
tainable development, which is the subject of the World Bank’s World Development Reports 1992, 
2002 and 2010. There are sections on the Stern Review on climate change, the impact of climate 
change on the poor, and the outcome of the climate change conference in Paris in December, 2015.
Part IV Financing economic development covers domestic and foreign resources.
Chapter 13 deals with the ﬁnancing of development from domestic resources. There is discus-
sion of the theory of ﬁnancial liberalization, together with critiques and empirical evidence of the 
relation between real interest rates, saving, investment and growth. There is new material on the 
ﬁnancial system in developing countries and the relationship between ﬁnancial development and 
economic development. Fiscal policy and taxation are also discussed, together with the topic of 
forced saving through inﬂation. New research is reported on the relation between inﬂation and 
growth, and the impact of inﬂation targeting.
Chapter 14 discusses the ﬁnance of development from external resources. All the statistics 
relating to foreign resource inﬂows have been updated, including the importance of remittances 
from abroad. The whole aid debate is reviewed, and the impact of aid on development. There are 
sections on the macroeconomic impact of aid and the critics of aid. Structural adjustment ­
lending 
by the World Bank and the role of foreign direct investment in the development process are 
examined. The debt-servicing problems created by foreign borrowing are thoroughly surveyed, 
and there is extensive discussion of international debt and the concept of optimal borrowing.
Part V Trade, the balance of payments and development contains two chapters.
Chapter 15 discusses trade theory, trade policy and economic development. The static and 
dynamic gains from trade are thoroughly explored (including the theory of customs unions and 
free trade areas), as are the ways in which the present pattern of trade works to the relative dis-
advantage of poor countries. The tendency of the terms of trade to deteriorate and for balance of 
payments diﬃculties to arise are stressed. There are sections on the theory and practice of trade lib-
eralization, and the impact that trade liberalization has had on export growth, import growth, the 
balance of payments, economic growth, domestic income inequality and ­
international in­
equality. 
What trade policies poor countries should pursue are also examined, and the ­
arguments given for 
various forms of protection.
Chapter 16 explores the important concept of balance of payments constrained growth and 
the various policy responses to this constraint at the national and international level. The latter 
involves a consideration of the extensive facilities aﬀorded by the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) for balance of payments support. Some of the criticisms levelled at the IMF are also consid-
ered. There is an analysis of the diﬀerent types of exchange rate systems that developing countries 
can adopt, and lessons to be drawn from the ﬁnancial crisis in East Asia in 1997. The chapter 
ends with a discussion of Special Drawing Rights as a potential form of international assistance to 
developing countries.
This new edition continues to provide the addresses of websites, chapter by chapter, to guide 
students to relevant information and data on the internet. When the next edition of this book 
becomes due in 2022, the facts pertaining to developing countries will again be out of date, and

no doubt there will have been new institutional changes and innovations in thinking about devel-
opment strategy. To keep abreast with what is going on, students are encouraged to consult pub-

UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF  
HUMAN RIGHTS
On 10 December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since then, it has been translated into more than 350 
languages worldwide and more than 100 African languages. There are 30 Articles, but we would 
like to highlight this one in particular:
Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself 
and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and the necessary social 
services and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widow-
hood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. (Article 25)

D E V E L O P M E N T  A N D  U N D E R D E V E L O P M E N T 
Introduction
We ask the reader (especially the young student) to consider, behind a veil of ignorance (Rawls, 
1972), what sort of world they would prefer to have been born into. A world in which nearly a 
billion people live on less than $1.90 a day (the official World Bank poverty line), with only a 5% 
chance of living a luxurious lifestyle or in a fairer world that provides a decent living standard 
for everyone wherever they are born – whether in Norway, the richest country, or Burundi, the 
poorest? Whatever answer you give, you will have shown an interest in development economics, 
which seeks to understand and explain why some countries are poor and others rich, and how to 
reduce poverty in poor countries to give everyone on the planet a minimum standard of life and 
freedom from hunger and fear of the future.
Development economics, as it is understood and taught today, is a relatively new subdiscipline 
of economics dating from the early years after the Second World War; but, in fact, the economic 
progress of nations has always been at the heart of economic enquiry, at least since the time of 
the great classical economists of the late eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth 
century – Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx. These 
writers were all concerned with understanding the growth and development process of coun-
tries and the factors determining the distribution of income between classes of people. Modern 
development economics has, in many ways, revived the old interests of the classical economists 
concerning the importance of saving, investment, capital accumulation, trade, and the mobiliza-
tion of surplus labour for structural change out of agriculture into manufacturing industry and 
service activities.
In this chapter we start by considering development economics as a subject – and academic 
interest in development issues – and why there has been a revival of development econom-
ics in the past 70 years, with many of the world’s best economists researching and writing on 
development matters. One of the major contributory factors has been the poorer countries of 
the world calling for a fairer deal from the functioning of the world economy, which they view 
as being biased against them. This demand for a new international economic order has been 
endorsed by all the major multilateral agencies established after the Second World War to over-
see international relations and a smoother functioning of the world economy after the economic 
chaos of the prewar era: the United Nations (UN) and its several affiliates, the World Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We shall discuss 
what a new international economic order might consist of, and the components of the new 
Sustainable Development Goals laid down in 2015, to be achieved by 2030, which replaced the 
Millennium Development Goals 2000–15.
Another major factor responsible for the growing interest and concern with developing coun-
tries, and the process of economic development itself, has been the increased globalization of the 
world economy, which has led to a greater interdependence between countries of the world. We 
shall consider what globalization means, and what forms interdependence takes.
We then turn to the meaning of development and the challenge of development economics, 
focusing particularly on the ideas of Denis Goulet and Amartya Sen, who argue powerfully and 
persuasively that economic development must mean much more than just a rise in the average 
level of per capita income of a country. A concept of development is required that embraces all 
the economic and social objectives and values that countries strive for – not simply material pro-
gress but, in particular, the self-esteem of peoples and nations, and freedom.
We end the chapter by considering the perpetuation of underdevelopment and poverty; that 
is, the forces in the world economy that historically have produced and continue today to create 
5

divisions between rich and poor countries, and even to widen them. Differences in the structure 
of production between countries, unequal trade, the dependency of poor countries on rich coun-
tries, and the operation of international institutions can all interact to produce ‘vicious circles’ of 
poverty and relative stagnation for countries that get left behind in the development ‘race’.
Development economics as a subject
The study of development economics as a separate subject in economics is a relatively new phe-
nomenon. For the student today, it will be difficult to appreciate that as recently as 60 years 
ago a course in development economics was a rare feature of an undergraduate programme in 
economics, and that textbooks on economic development were few and far between. Today, no 
respectable department of economics is without at least one course in economic development; 
there are scores of texts and thousands of case studies and articles on the subject.
The political and public concern with poverty and the poorer nations of the world is of equally 
recent origin. As far as poverty is concerned, Ravallion (2013), a former research director at the 
World Bank, has charted the evolution of attitudes to poverty over the past three centuries and con-
cludes that the current worldwide consensus on raising people out of poverty is surprisingly recent. 
Up to the nineteenth century, the plight of the poor was largely blamed on themselves and, besides, 
poverty was socially useful because it provided plentiful cheap labour for industrial development. 
In the nineteenth century, some protection was provided for the poor in some Western countries, 
but little concerted action to reduce poverty itself. It was not until the second half of the twentieth 
century that a coherent theoretical framework emerged to show how high levels of poverty stifled 
effort, investment and growth, through lack of education, poor health and nutrition (see Chapter 7).
As far as poorer nations are concerned, the majority of the national and international bodies 
that exist today to promote development, such as national development banks, the World Bank 
and its affiliates, and agencies of the UN, were established after the Second World War in the 1940s 
and 1950s. Before the war, when most of today’s poor countries were still colonies, there was much 
less focus on the economic and social problems of the developing (dependent) economies than 
there is today. Perhaps the facts were not so well known, or perhaps the attention of most people 
was focused on depression and unemployment in developed countries. Whatever the reason, the 
situation today is very different. The development of low-income and middle-income countries, 
meaning above all the eradication of acute poverty, is now regarded as one of the greatest social 
and economic challenges facing mankind, together with environmental pollution and climate 
change. As the Pearson Report (1969) remarked a generation ago, ‘the widening gap between the 
developed and the developing countries has become the central problem of our times’.
What accounts for this change in attitude and upsurge of interest in the economics of devel-
opment and the economies of poor countries? A number of factors can be pinpointed, which 
interrelate with one another:
1.	 In the wake of the great depression of the 1930s, and in the aftermath of war, there was re-
newed interest among professional economists in the growth and development process and 
the theory and practice of planning.
2.	 The poor countries themselves have become increasingly aware of their own backwardness, 
which has led to a natural desire for more rapid economic progress.
3.	 The absolute numbers of poor people are considerably greater now than in the past, and 
­
greater awareness has struck a humanitarian chord in the world at large.
6
D E V E L O P M E N T  A N D  U N D E R D E V E L O P M E N T 
4.	 There has been a growing recognition by all concerned of the interdependence between coun-
tries in the world economy. The old Cold War between the capitalist West and the communist 
East led the major developed countries to show a growing economic and political interest 
in poor and ideologically uncommitted nations. The political and military ramifications and 
dangers of a world divided into rich and poor countries are even more serious now than they 
were in the past. The recognition of interdependence has also been heightened in recent years 
by the process of globalization, making all countries more vulnerable to shocks and financial 
crises, which spread through trade and capital movements.
Academic interest in development
As mentioned earlier, academic interest in the mechanics of growth and development is a 
renewed interest rather than an entirely new preoccupation of economists. The progress and 
material well-being of people and nations have traditionally been at the centre of economic writ-
ing and enquiry. It constituted one of the major areas of interest of the classical economists. Adam 
Smith, David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus, John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx all dealt at some length 
(albeit with divergent opinions on many issues) with the causes and consequences of economic 
advance (see Chapter 4). It is entirely natural that thinkers of the day should comment on the 
contemporary scene. There is perhaps an analogy here between the preoccupation of the classical 
economists at the time of Britain’s Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centur­
ies and the concern of many economists today with the economics of development and world 
poverty. The list of modern-day economists who have turned their fertile minds to the study of 
economic development reads like a Who’s Who of economics. Distinguished economists (past 
and present) who immediately come to mind are Abhijit Banerjee, Kaushik Basu, Pranab Bardhan, 
Jagdish Bhagwati, Hollis Chenery, Paul Collier, Partha Dasgupta, Angus Deaton, Esther Duflo, 
Albert Hirschman, Harry Johnson, Nicholas Kaldor, Michal Kalecki, Paul Krugman, Simon Kuznets, 
Harvey Leibenstein, Arthur Lewis, James Mirrlees, Gunnar Myrdal, Raúl Prebisch, Dani Rodrik, Joan 
Robinson, Paul Rosenstein-Rodan, Walt Rostow, Jeffrey Sachs, Theodore Schultz, Amartya Sen, 
Hans Singer, Nicholas Stern, Joseph Stiglitz and Jan Tinbergen (our apologies to those we left out).
The question is often posed of what lessons, if any, the present developing countries can draw 
from the first-hand observations of the classical writers or, more directly, from the development 
experience of the present advanced nations. One obvious lesson is that while development can be 
regarded as a natural process, it is also a lengthy one, at least if left to itself. It is easy to forget that 
it took Europe the best part of three centuries to progress from a subsistence state to economic 
maturity. Much of development economics is concerned with the timescale of development, and 
how to speed up the process of development in a way that is consistent with freedom and democ-
racy. Later in the present millennium, when primary poverty in most countries will, one hopes, 
have been eradicated, courses in development economics will undoubtedly take a different form. 
The emphasis will be on intercountry comparisons rather than on the process of development as 
such and on the growth pains accompanying the transition from a primarily agrarian to an indus-
trial or service economy.
As far as classical economic theory is concerned, the gloomy prognostication of Ricardo, 
Malthus and Mill that progress will ultimately end in stagnation would seem to be unfounded. 
It has certainly been confounded by experience. Population growth and diminishing returns in 
agriculture have not been uniformly depressive to the extent that Ricardo and Malthus supposed. 
Rising productivity and per capita incomes have accompanied the growth of population and the 
7
1  •  T H E  S T U D Y  O F  E C O N O M I C  D E V E L O P M E N T
extension of agriculture. Classical development economics greatly underestimated the beneficial 
role of technical progress and international trade in the development process. It is these two fac-
tors above all others that seem to have confounded the pessimism of much of classical theory. 
With access to superior technology, there is hope, and some evidence, that material progress in 
today’s developing countries will be much more rapid than in countries at a similar stage of devel-
opment 200 years ago. The pool of technology on which to draw, and the scope for its assimilation, 
is enormous. Used with discretion, it must be considered as the main means of increasing welfare.
The role of trade, however, is more problematic. Much will depend on how rapidly the devel-
oping countries can alter their industrial structure, and on movements in the terms of trade. 
Currently, the developing countries are probably in an inferior position compared with the pre-
sent advanced countries at a comparable stage of their economic history. There are potential 
dynamic gains from trade, but the static efficiency gains based on primary production are weak, 
and the terms of trade in most commodities are worse. The gains from trade accrue mainly to 
the rich industrialized countries, notwithstanding the rapid increase that periodically takes place 
in some commodity prices, as witnessed in recent years. The fact that the gains from trade are 
unequally distributed does not, of course, destroy the potential link between trade and growth, 
or constitute an argument against trade. Rather, it represents a challenge for altering the structure 
of trade and the terms on which it takes place.
Then there is the question of planning. Classical economists were generally opposed to inter-
ference with the market mechanism, believing that the free play of market forces would maximize 
the social good. But fashions change in economics, and after the Second World War there was a 
much greater acceptance of interference with the market mechanism, so that planning in devel-
oping countries was seen by many as one of the main means by which economic development 
could be accelerated. In many countries, the experience of planning has not been favourable, 
however, and planning has come into disrepute, not least because of the economic disarray of the 
rigidly planned economies of the old Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It should never be forgot-
ten, however, that no country in the world ever made such a swift economic advance in such a 
short space of time as the Soviet Union did after 1918, through a planned allocation of resources 
that favoured investment at the expense of consumption. The fact that planning may be operated 
too rigidly, or for too long and go wrong, should not be allowed to obscure the fact that it also 
has merits, and that unfettered free enterprise can also lead to economic failure and social depriv­
ation. There can be market failure as well as government failure. What is required in most develop-
ing countries is a judicious mix of public and private enterprise, with the use of markets combined 
with different types of government involvement, for the maximization of social welfare. The state 
has a role to play in economic development (see Chapter 9).
Planning requires a certain amount of model-building, and this too has been inspired by econo-
mists. The most common type of model, which forms the basis of much of the model-building that 
developing countries practise, is to calculate the investment requirements necessary to achieve a 
target rate of growth of per capita income – commonly referred to as the Harrod–Domar model 
(see Chapter 4). Neither the models of Harrod (1939) or Domar (1947) were designed for the pur-
pose to which they are now put in developing countries, but their growth equations have proved 
to be an indispensable component of macroeconomic planning. In Chapter 9, we shall consider 
the strengths and weaknesses of using this type of aggregate model in development planning, and 
the arguments for and against planning in general.
As a result of the apparent failure of development planning and the slow progress made by 
many developing countries in the 1970s, the status of the discipline of development economics 
began to be called into question in the 1980s and several obituaries of the subject were written (see, 
8
D E V E L O P M E N T  A N D  U N D E R D E V E L O P M E N T 
e.g., Hirschman, 1981; Little, 1982; Lal, 1983). We will concentrate here on the worries expressed 
by Hirschman, the practitioner who first rang the alarm bells most vigorously. Hirschman argues 
that development economics was originally born out of a rejection of monoeconomics (that is, 
the universality of neoclassical economics) on the one hand and neo-Marxism on the other, which 
asserted that economic relations between developed and less developed countries could only 
lead to the development of underdevelopment. The two themes at the forefront of the rejection 
of monoeconomics were the existence of a massive amount of surplus labour in agriculture in 
developing countries, and backwardness or late industrialization – the latter requiring active state 
intervention. In terms of policy, the major strategic themes emphasized and pursued by develop-
ing countries were the mobilization of underemployed manpower, rapid capital accumulation 
and industrialization, for all of which planning was thought to be necessary.
Hirschman’s first explanation of the alleged demise of development economics is the resur-
gence of neoclassical orthodoxy and rejection of the view that there is a separate economics 
applic­
able to poor countries, as distinct from developed ones. The defence of monoeconomics 
has been buttressed by the observed success of some ostensibly free-market developing coun-
tries, such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore (the so-called ‘East Asian miracle’ 
countries), and the failure of planning in others.
Early development economics not only asserted the need for a separate economics applicable 
to developing countries, but also believed that the integration of developing countries into the 
world economy would bring material benefits to rich and poor alike. Hirschman’s second explan­
ation of the alleged demise of development economics is that the subject has not only been 
attacked by the neoclassical school, but also by neo-Marxists who reject the claim of mutual 
benefit. Thus, development economics has been squeezed, as if in a vice, from both ends of the 
politico-economic spectrum.
What can be said in response? It is not difficult to defend the traditional preoccupations of 
development theory and development policy. Amartya Sen (1983) and Syed Naqvi (1996) show 
that the focus on mobilizing surplus labour, capital accumulation and industrialization has not 
been misplaced. It can be seen from the international evidence that many high-growth countries 
(and this is particularly true of Southeast Asian countries, including China) have drawn exten-
sively on surplus labour from the rural sector, that investment and growth are highly correlated 
across countries, and that the best growth performers are those countries where the share of 
industrial output in gross domestic product (GDP) is rising most rapidly. Those defending the 
rejection of monoeconomics have not retreated into their shells, and very few economists would 
disagree that there is mutual benefit to be had from country interaction. It is not conceivable 
that the majority of developing countries would be absolutely better off if they were isolated and 
autarchic, although this is not to say that some ‘delinking’ and strategic protection may not be 
desirable and that the gains from globalization and interdependence could not be more equitably 
distributed across countries.
But is there a separate ‘development economics’? Most observers would still argue that poor 
countries differ from the rich in such a way that different concepts, models and theories are 
required to understand their functioning in many respects. While it might be argued that the 
basic microeconomic assumptions about how people behave are similar for all countries, devel-
oping countries still differ structurally from rich ones and therefore require different models. The 
differences between the two sets of countries are large, particularly in relation to resource alloca-
tion and matters relating to long-term growth. It is not accidental that social cost–benefit analysis 
has been largely developed and refined within the context of developing countries, or that devel-
oping countries have been the breeding ground for theories of tendencies towards disequilibrium 
9
1  •  T H E  S T U D Y  O F  E C O N O M I C  D E V E L O P M E N T
in economic and social systems – models of virtuous and vicious circles and centre–periphery 
models of growth and development. But as Arthur Lewis (1984), one of the fathers of develop-
ment economics, once said in his presidential lecture to the American Economic Association, the 
central task of development economics is to provide a general framework for an understanding of 
the pace and rhythm of growth and development. As Lewis (1984) put it:
the economists’ dream would be to have a single theory of growth that took an economy from 
the lowest level … past the dividing line … up to the level of Western Europe and beyond … 
or to have at least one good theory for the developing economy … to the dividing line.
That is what development economics is all about. Development economics is the only branch of 
economics that attempts to understand and explain the nature of the development process 
(Naqvi, 1996).
But even if the need for a separate development economics could not be established, would 
this jeopardize the status of the subject? It might be argued that in the interests of scientific 
respectability, there is a strong case for thinking of economics as a unified body of theory and 
doctrine, and not a subject of compartments. What leads to compartmentalization is the wide 
diversity of subject areas, which then gives rise to the descriptive labels of monetary econom-
ics, labour economics, regional economics and so on, but all these subdisciplines employ a large 
measure of economic theory that is common to economics as a whole.
What distinguishes the subdiscipline is first and foremost the area of application and only 
secondarily the distinctive theory. A favourite definition of economics is that ‘economics is what 
economists do’. By analogy, ‘development economics is what development economists do’. The 
development literature indicates that they do a number of things that other economists do not 
do, and in the process they both invent new models, and adapt and modify existing theory in the 
light of circumstances. Any contribution that a subdiscipline makes by way of theoretical devel-
opment enriches economics as a whole, and may well have application elsewhere. New models, 
concepts and ideas invented by development economists include the following:
•
• The concept of the low-level equilibrium trap
•
• The theory of the ‘big push’
•
• Dynamic externalities
•
• Models of dualism
•
• The theory of circular and cumulative causation
•
• The concept of dependency
•
• Growth pole analysis
•
• Models of population and growth
•
• Models of rural–urban migration
•
• Refinements to social cost–benefit analysis
•
• The notion of immiserizing growth
•
• Models of structural inflation
•
• The concept of dual-gap analysis
•
• The theory of missing markets
•
• The study of rent-seeking, and so on.
None of these innovations has been borrowed from other branches of economics, but other 
branches of economics have borrowed liberally from the expanding toolkit forged by development 
economists. International economics is no longer taught within the straitjacket of equilibrium

D E V E L O P M E N T  A N D  U N D E R D E V E L O P M E N T 
economics. Labour economics has taken on board the concepts of dualism and dual labour mar-
kets, while structural inflation and dual-gap analysis are part of the language of macroeconomics. 
As Bardhan (1993) concludes:
While the problems of the world’s poor remain as overwhelming as ever, studying them has 
generated enough analytical ideas and thrown up enough challenges to the dominant para-
digm to make all of us in the profession somewhat wiser, and at least somewhat more con-
scious of the possibilities and limitations of our existing methods of analysis.
Finally, how should one respond to the charge that development economics has not produced 
the results expected of it? As Hirschman (1981) put it, the developing countries were ‘expected 
to perform like wind-up toys and “lumber through” the various stages of development single-
mindedly … these countries were perceived to have only interests and no passions’. If the expect­
ations have not materialized, this probably has more to do with the expectations being unrealistic 
than with deficiencies in the theory and practice of development economics. This, in turn, may 
have something to do with economists in general losing their historical sense and perspective. 
The process of development is a long and protracted one. It took over 200 years for the present 
developed countries to progress from Rostow’s traditional stage of economic development to 
economic maturity and high mass consumption. Arthur Lewis (1984) bemoaned the loss of his-
torical perspective, which he attributed to the poor training of economists:
If our subject is lowering its sights, this may be because the demise of economic history in 
economics departments has brought us a generation of economists with no historical back-
ground. This is in marked contrast with the development economists of the 1950s, practically 
all of whom had some historical training, and guided by Gerschenkron and Rostow, looked to 
history for enlightenment on the processes of development.
Students beware: learn your history!
Where do we stand today? At present, there is a resurgence of academic interest in the growth 
and development process, inspired by the ‘new’ endogenous growth theory and the increased avail-
ability of large datasets that facilitate interesting and rigorous econometric work on the major deter-
minants of intercountry growth performance. Paul Krugman (1992) described the 1950s and 1960s 
as the years of ‘high development theory’, when many important models of development were 
formulated but were lost sight of because they were not formulated rigorously enough. Now the 
ideas are being brought back into play by more skilled theoreticians. The central core of ideas that 
emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, which were largely swept away during the neoclassical counter­
revolution, but which Krugman believes still remain valid, were external economies, increasing 
returns, complementarity between sectors and linkages. It is these ideas that have been recap-
tured by the ‘new’ endogenous growth theory (and which remained alive outside the mainstream 
in the works of economists such as Nicholas Kaldor and Kenneth Arrow – see Chapter 4).
‘New’ growth theory provides an answer to the question of why per capita income differences 
in the world economy seem to be as persistent as ever when conventional neoclassical growth the-
ory predicts convergence. The answer is that there are many externalities that prevent the marginal 
product of capital from falling as countries grow richer, so that the level of investment matters 
for growth, and growth is endogenous in this sense – not simply determined by an ex­
ogenously 
given rate of technical progress, common to all countries. Indeed, technical progress is also largely 
endogenous, determined by research and development and education. This theory tells us what 
11
1  •  T H E  S T U D Y  O F  E C O N O M I C  D E V E L O P M E N T
sustains growth, but it does not address the question of what it is that gets growth started. To 
answer this, we need to go to the roots of economic development, which initially lie in the perfor-
mance of the rural economy and agriculture (see Chapter 5).
The new empirical development economics
In recent years, theorizing in development economics has left centre-stage and given way to a 
much greater amount of empirical work made possible by the availability of large datasets at 
both the macro- and micro-level, and the development of user-friendly software for data hand­
ling. Whether this shift is desirable is debatable, and has been debated by the distinguished 
development economists Abhijit Banerjee, Pranab Bardhan, Kaushik Basu, Ravi Kanbur and Dilip 
Mookherjee in the prestigious Indian periodical, Economic and Political Weekly (Kanbur, 2005). 
One inherent danger of empirics is always ‘measurement without theory’, but today most empir­
ical work in development economics is not of this type. It is mainly to test theoretical hypoth-
eses about decision-making and economic behaviour at the micro-level, and about relationships 
between variables at the macro-level. In the former case, randomized control trials (RCTs) have 
become popular (see Banerjee and Duflo, 2011). In the latter case, the problem is one of deducing 
causation from correlations when most variables in the economic system are endogenous, that 
is, dependent on each other. One big advantage of RCTs is that they overcome the econometric 
problems associated with regression and correlation analysis relating to causation, endogeneity 
and identification. Some economists argue (e.g. Mookherjee, in Kanbur, 2005) that there is now 
too much empirics and not enough theory – that the balance has swung too far. The debate, how-
ever, is a sterile one because for understanding social science in general, and in the attack on pov-
erty in particular, both theory and empirics are required. One without the other leaves economic 
policy-making in limbo. The way forward suggested by Mookherjee is a four-stage approach:
•
• Stage 1: empirical description of the relevant phenomenon.
•
• Stage 2: formulation of a relevant theory that might explain the phenomenon.
•
• Stage 3: testing and estimation of theory, maybe leading to a modification or replacement of 
previous theories.
•
• Stage 4: use of ‘best’ theory for purposes of prediction and policy evaluation.
This is the most sensible strategy for development economists to follow. As Kanbur (2005) con-
cludes: ‘good sense will surely prevail and we will have both more theory and more good empirical 
work – a goldilocks solution for development economics’.
A new international economic order
Another major factor accounting for the upsurge of interest in the growth and development pro-
cess has been the poor nations’ own increased awareness of their inferior economic and political 
status in the world, and their desire for material improvement and greater political recognition 
through economic strength. This was precipitated by decolonization in the 1950s and 1960s and 
increased contact with developed nations, and has been strengthened from within by rising expect­
ations as development has proceeded. Development is required to provide people with the basic 
necessities of life, for their own sake, and to provide a degree of self-esteem and freedom for people, 
which is precluded by poverty. Wealth and material possessions may not necessarily provide greater 
 
12
D E V E L O P M E N T  A N D  U N D E R D E V E L O P M E N T 
happiness but they widen individuals’ choices, which is an important aspect of freedom and welfare. 
The developing countries have also called for a fairer deal from the functioning of the world econ-
omy, which they view, with some justification, as biased in favour of countries that are already rich.
The official call for a new international economic order was first made during the Sixth Special 
Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1974. The UN pledged itself:
to work urgently for the establishment of a new international economic order based on equity, 
sovereign equality, common interest and cooperation among all states, irrespective of their 
economic and social systems, which shall correct inequalities and redress existing injustices, 
make it possible to eliminate the widening gap between the developed and the developing 
countries and ensure steadily accelerating economic and social development and peace and 
justice for present and future generations.
The programme of action called for such things as:
•
• Improved terms of trade for the exports of poor countries.
•
• Greater access to the markets of developed countries for manufactured goods.
•
• Greater financial assistance and the alleviation of past debt.
•
• Reform of the International Monetary Fund and a greater say in decision-making on inter­
national bodies concerned with trade and development issues.
•
• An international food programme.
•
• Greater technical cooperation.
The call for a new international economic order has been reiterated several times by various 
UN agencies. In 1975, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) pro-
duced the Lima Declaration, which set a target for developing countries to secure a 25% share 
of world manufacturing production by the year 2000 compared with the share then of 10%. The 
target was just met, thanks to rapid industrial growth in East Asia and the Pacific, and the share 
now stands at just over 30%. On the monetary front, in 1980, the Arusha Declaration demanded 
a UN Conference on International Money and Finance to create a new international monetary 
order ‘capable of achieving monetary stability, restoring acceptable levels of employment and 
sustainable growth’ and ‘supportive of a process of global development’. This goal has not been 
achieved. Since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971/72, no formal international 
monetary order has been created.
In 1995, a UN World Development Summit was held in Copenhagen, focusing on social devel-
opment and employment issues. The Copenhagen Declaration made several commitments:
•
• Full employment, equality between men and women, and universal access to education and 
healthcare should be basic priorities.
•
• Overall development aid should be increased for spending in areas of social policy.
•
• Developed countries should allocate 20% of their aid to basic social projects and, in return, 
developing countries should spend at least 20% of their budgets on social needs.
•
• The IMF and the World Bank should pay more attention to social factors when designing pro-
grammes.
Progress in these areas has been slow.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), based in Geneva, 
regularly calls for new policy initiatives in the four major areas of debt relief, international aid, 
commodity policy, and trade promotion for developing countries.
13

Then, prior to the new millennium in 2000, the countries of the world, through the UN and 
other bodies, agreed on a set of Millennium Development Goals, which set 8 goals and 18 devel-
opment targets to be achieved by the year 2015 compared to the position in 1990 (see Table 1.1). 
Table 1.1  Millennium Development Goals and Targets

The most important commitment was to half the proportion of people living in absolute poverty, 
using $1 a day as the poverty line. This meant a reduction from a poverty rate of 41.6% in 1990 to 
20.8% in 2015. This target was met globally, largely as a result of the dramatic fall in the numbers 
in poverty in China. Taking Africa and Asia as a whole, the target was not met.
Other goals met were halving the proportion of people without access to safe water, and 
reducing the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis. Important targets not met were: reducing 
by three-quarters the incidence of infant and maternal mortality; universal primary education; 
gender equality, and the HIV reversal target.
Sustainable Development Goals
In 2015, a new set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was set out at a special conference 
of the UN. There are 169 proposed targets grouped into 17 goals, which are listed in Table 1.2. The 
SDGs are more ambitious than the Millennium Development Goals, extending to such things as 
urbanization, infrastructure and climate change. Each of the goals addresses one or more aspects of 
poverty, and all are mutually reinforcing. For example, higher school enrolment, especially for girls, 
reduces poverty and mortality. Better basic healthcare will increase school enrolment and reduce 
poverty. Many poor people depend on the environment for their living, so a better en­
vironment 
will help poor people. However, the multiplicity of goals and targets have been ­
criticized for being

too diffuse and lacking focus. It may be self-defeating to have so many ‘priorities’ if any of them 
are to be achieved. Clearly, the most important goals are the first four: ending poverty everywhere; 
ending hunger; ensuring healthy lives, and equal access to education for everyone.
Globalization and interdependence of the world economy
A third major factor responsible for the growing concern with poor nations is the increased glo-
balization of the world economy, leading to a greater interdependence between countries of 
the world. There have been three major eras of globalization in the past 150 years. The first was 
from 1870 up to the First World War (1914), which witnessed large-scale capital flows and labour 
migration from Europe to the American continent and the colonies. The second started after the 
Second World War (1945) with the freeing of trade. The third phase started in the 1980s, based 
on technological advances in communications and transport. Fischer (2003) has given a useful, 
succinct definition of globalization:
the ongoing process of greater economic interdependence among countries reflected in the 
increasing amount of cross-border trade in goods and services, the increasing volume of inter-
national financial flows and increasing flows of labour.
As far as the interdependence between developed and developing countries is concerned, 
developing countries depend on developed countries for resource flows and technology, while 
developed countries depend heavily on developing countries for raw materials, food and oil, and 
as markets for industrial goods. The term ‘globalization’ refers to all those forces operating in the 
world economy that increase interdependence, while making countries more and more depend-
ent on forces outside their control, as time, space and borders diminish in importance. Foremost 
among these forces are:
•
• The widening and freeing of trade. Over 30% of the world’s output of goods and services is now 
traded.
•
• The growth of global capital markets and the greater flow of short-term speculative capital: 
over $3 trillion are exchanged on the world’s currency markets every day.
•
• More foreign direct investment (FDI) by giant multinational corporations with greater power 
and assets than many national governments.
•
• The growth of global value chains with firms sourcing inputs from the cheapest international 
markets.
•
• The greater movement of people than ever before, breaking down cultural barriers, but also 
leading to the spread of disease (e.g. AIDS) and international crime in drugs, people-trafficking, 
prostitution and arms.
•
• The spread of information technology (IT), which can exacerbate contagion in financial markets.
•
• New institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), with authority over national 
governments, and new multilateral agreements on trade, services, intellectual property, which 
reduce national autonomy.
All these aspects of globalization and interdependence make countries more vulnerable to shocks 
such as:
•
• World recessions and downturns in world trade, as occurred in the early 1980s and precipitated 
the debt crisis.
16
D E V E L O P M E N T  A N D  U N D E R D E V E L O P M E N T 
•
• Financial crises, such as the Asian crisis of 1997, and the banking crisis in the US and UK in 
2007/8, which became contagious and spread like a disease, affecting not only the countries of 
origin but other parts of the world too.
•
• Commodity price rises (including the price of oil), which in 2008 more than doubled for several 
basic foods, such as maize and rice, leading to food riots in several poor countries.
In recent years, there have been major protests at meetings of the WTO and the World Economic 
Forum in Davos (Switzerland) by groups concerned with the damage done by globalization, par-
ticularly to the poorer countries in the world economy, which tend to be most exposed to, and 
suffer most from, the forces of competition and global capital movements. Competitive markets 
may be the best guarantee of efficiency, but not necessarily of equity. As the Human Development 
Report of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP, 1999) put it:
The challenge of globalisation in the new century is not to stop the expansion of global mar-
kets. The challenge is to find the rules and institutions for stronger governance – local, ­
national, 
regional and global – to preserve the advantages of global markets and competition, but also 
to provide enough space for human, community and environmental resources to ensure that 
globalisation works for people – not just for profits.
So far, more progress has been made in promoting the institutions of globalization than in pro-
tecting people against the consequences of globalization. The UNDP calls for globalization tem-
pered by:
•
• Ethics – less violation of human rights
•
• Equity – less disparity within and between nations
•
• Inclusion – less marginalization of people and countries
•
• Human security – less instability of countries and less vulnerability of people
•
• Sustainability – less environmental destruction
•
• Development – less poverty and deprivation.
When the actions of any one country, or group of countries, result in consequences for others 
(good or bad), the effects become a type of public good or externality. The task of the inter­
national community in these circumstances is to maximize the spread of public ‘goods’ that con-
fer positive externalities (e.g. technology, information, healthcare) and to minimize the spread 
of public ‘bads’ (e.g. disease, pollution, financial contagion). It is in the self-interest of the inter­
national community to assist developing countries in particular, not only because they are poor 
but also to enable them to make their contribution to the provision of essential global public 
‘goods’ (and to minimize the production of public ‘bads’, e.g. AIDS in Africa).
Globalization and, particularly, interdependence mean that the malfunctioning of one set of 
economies impairs the functioning of others. This was never more evident than in the world 
economy in the 1980s, when the rising price of energy and the debt crisis led to mounting eco-
nomic chaos. The 1980 Brandt Report, entitled North–South: A Programme for Survival, and its 
sequel Common Crisis: North–South Co-operation for World Recovery (Brandt Commission, 1983), 
stressed the mutual benefit to all countries of a sustained programme of development in poorer 
countries, and documented the prevailing adverse trends in the world economy, which pointed 
to a sombre future if not tackled cooperatively:
•
• Growing poverty and hunger in developing countries.
•
• Rising unemployment with inflation.
17
1  •  T H E  S T U D Y  O F  E C O N O M I C  D E V E L O P M E N T
•
• International monetary disorder.
•
• Chronic balance of payments deficits and mounting debts in most developing countries.
•
• Protectionism, and tensions between countries competing for energy, food and raw materials.
Nothing much has changed since the 1980s. Poverty and hunger are still rife in the world. Tens 
of millions of people in poor countries lack productive employment. Civil wars in North Africa 
are leading to the mass migration of refugees and dispossessed people to Europe. There is inter­
national monetary disorder. There are chronic global imbalances of payments between countries, 
and international debt continues to grow. And there are growing tensions between countries for 
energy, food and raw materials. Development economics addresses itself to many of the issues 
contributing to disarray in the world economy.
There is not only a moral case for greater efforts to raise living standards in poor countries, but 
a purely practical case that it is in the interests of the developed countries themselves. The ability 
of poor countries to sustain their growth and development means a greater demand for the goods 
and services of developed countries, which generates output and employment directly and also 
helps to maintain the balance of payments stability of these countries, which is so crucial if there 
is to be a reciprocal demand for the goods of developing countries. Any constraint on demand 
in the system arising from, say, poor agricultural performance in poor countries, or a balance of 
payments constraint on demand in developed countries, will impair the functioning of the whole 
world economy and reduce the rate of progress below potential. Herein lies the importance of 
the transfer of resources to poor countries to maintain their momentum of development (global 
Keynesianism), and of international monetary reform to smooth the burden of balance of pay-
ments adjustment and to shift more of the burden of adjustment from the deficit to the surplus 
countries.
The Brandt Report (1980) called for:
•
• A long-term programme to meet the basic needs of poor countries, involving additional re-
source transfers of $4 billion a year ($15 billion at 2016 prices).
•
• A major effort to improve agricultural productivity to end mass hunger and malnutrition.
•
• Commodity schemes to stabilize the terms of trade for primary commodities.
•
• Easier access to world markets for the exports of developing countries.
•
• Programmes for energy conservation.
•
• The development of more appropriate technologies for poor countries.
•
• An international progressive income tax, and levies on trade and arms production, to be used 
by a new World Development Fund (to fund development programmes rather than projects).
•
• A link between the creation of new international money and aid to developing countries.
•
• Policies to recycle balance of payments surpluses (as accumulated by the Arab oil exporting 
countries since 1973 and China since the 1990s, for example) to deficit countries to remove 
balance of payments constraints on demand and remove the risk of a slide into international 
protectionism.
To this list, we could add new forms of global governance to cope with the consequences of glo-
balization, which also represent the interests of those countries that suffer most from the effects 
of globalization: the poor and marginalized. This list of priorities is as relevant today as it ever was.
We shall discuss many of these issues in the course of this book. Such a programme of action 
would be of mutual benefit to all parties, rich and poor. It would create investment confidence, 
which is the crucial ingredient maintaining the dynamics of any economic system; it would also 
stimulate trade and investment, and help the prospects of sustained growth in the world economy.
18
D E V E L O P M E N T  A N D  U N D E R D E V E L O P M E N T 
It would be wrong to give the impression, however, that developed countries’ concern with world 
poverty is motivated exclusively by the selfish realization that their own survival depends on eco-
nomic and political harmony, which cannot thrive in a world perpetually divided into rich and poor. 
There has also been an affirmation by many developed countries of a moral obligation towards 
poorer nations. Not all aid and development assistance is politically inspired. Particularly over the 
past four decades, developed countries have shown a genuine humanitarian concern over the plight 
of poor developing countries. The goal of a greater degree of income equality between the citizens 
of a nation seems to be gaining support, albeit slowly, as an objective among nations. Moreover, the 
propagation of this ideal is not confined to the supranational institutions that have been especially 
established to further it. Recent years have witnessed the spontaneous creation of several national 
pressure groups in different parts of the world, whose platform is the abolition of world poverty. 
In the UK, bodies such as Drop the Debt and Make Poverty History have a strong voice. Aid from 
voluntary agencies to developing countries now amounts to over $10 billion annually. But whatever 
the motive for concern, the reality of world poverty and underdevelopment cannot be ignored. 
Furthermore, acute poverty in developing countries is likely to persist for many years to come. The 
economist has a special responsibility to contribute to an understanding of the economic difficulties 
that poor countries face and to point to possible solutions. This textbook is devoted to that end.
We start by considering the meaning of development and the perpetuation of underdevelop-
ment. Then in Chapters 2 and 3, we consider the measurement of poverty, the magnitude of the 
development gap in the world economy, and the major characteristics of underdevelopment, 
particularly the economic structure of developing countries geared to the production and export 
of primary products and low value-added manufactured goods.
The meaning of development and the challenge of development 
economics
Development implies change, and this is one sense in which the term ‘development’ is used; that is, 
to describe the process of economic and social transformation within countries. This process often 
follows a well-ordered sequence and exhibits common characteristics across countries, which we 
shall discuss later in the chapter. But if development becomes an objective of policy, the important 
question arises: development for what? Not so long ago, the concept of development was con-
ceived of almost exclusively in terms of growth targets, with very little regard to the beneficiaries of 
growth or the composition of output. Societies are not indifferent, however, to the distributional 
consequences of economic policy, to the type of output that is produced, or to the economic 
en­
vironment in which it is produced. A concept of development is required that embraces the 
major economic and social objectives and values that societies strive for. This is not easy. One 
attempt is by Goulet (1971, 2006), who distinguishes three basic components or core values in this 
wider meaning of development, which he calls life-sustenance, self-esteem and freedom:
•
• Life-sustenance is concerned with the provision of basic needs, which we shall discuss in Chap-
ter 3. The basic needs approach to development was initiated by the World Bank in the 1970s. 
No country may be regarded as fully developed if it cannot provide all its people with such ­
basic 
needs as housing, clothing, food and minimal education. A major objective of development 
must be to raise people out of acute poverty and, at the same time, to provide basic needs.
•
• Self-esteem is concerned with the feeling of self-respect and independence. No country can 
be regarded as fully developed if it is exploited by others and does not have the power and 
19

influence to conduct relations on equal terms. Developing countries seek development for self-
esteem; to eradicate the feeling of dominance and dependence that is associated with inferior 
economic status.
•
• Freedom refers to freedom from the three evils of ‘want, ignorance and squalor’, so that people 
are more able to determine their own destiny. No person is free if they cannot choose; if they 
are imprisoned by living on the margin of subsistence with no education and no skills. The 
advantage of material development is that it expands the range of human choice open to indi-
viduals and societies at large.
These three core components are interrelated. Lack of self-esteem and freedom result from low 
levels of life sustenance, and both lack of self-esteem and economic imprisonment become links 
in a circular, self-perpetuating chain of poverty, by producing a sense of fatalism and acceptance of 
the established order – the ‘accommodation to poverty’, as the famous economist J.K. Galbraith 
(1980) once called it.
Goulet’s three core components of development are also related to Amartya Sen’s vision of 
development (Sen, 1981, 1983, 1999), defined in terms of the expansion of people’s entitlements 
and capabilities, the former giving life sustenance and self-esteem, the latter giving freedom. Sen 
defines entitlements as the set of alternative commodity bundles that a person can command in 
a society using the totality of rights and obligations that they face, and entitlements generate the 
capability to do certain things. According to Sen, the capabilities of a person reflect the alternative 
combinations of functionings the person can achieve, and from which they can choose one col-
lection. The approach is based on a view of living as a combination of various ‘beings and doings’, 
with the quality of life to be assessed in terms of the capabilities to achieve valuable functionings.
Economic development should be thought of in terms of the expansion of entitlements and 
capabilities, which are not necessarily well captured by aggregate measures of output growth. For 
most people, entitlements depend on their ability to sell their labour and on the price of com-
modities. It is not only the market mechanism that determines entitlements, however, but also 
such factors as power relations in society, the spatial distribution of resources in society, such as 
schools and healthcare, and what individuals can extract from the state.
In the final analysis, Sen views freedom as the primary objective of development, as well 
as the principal means of achieving development. Development consists of the removal of 
various types of ‘unfreedoms’ that leave people with little choice and opportunity. Major cat-
egories of ‘unfreedom’ include famine and undernourishment, poor health and lack of basic 
needs, a lack of political liberty and basic civil rights, and economic insecurity. Development 
should be regarded as a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy. The growth 
of per capita income is only a means to that end. The ideas and views of Amartya Sen, who won 
the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1998 for his work on the interface between welfare and devel-
opment economics, have been enormously influential within the international community 
and can be seen in the World Bank’s World Development Report 2000/2001, which is devoted 
to the topic of how to expand the entitlements, capabilities and freedom of poor people (see 
Chapter 2).
These concepts and ideas of Goulet and Sen are part of what Qizilbash (1996) calls eth­
ical development. Drawing on the work of Griffin (1986) in his book Well-Being: Its Meaning, 
Measurement and Moral Importance, Qizilbash (1996) suggests nine core values by which devel-
opment should be defined:
•
• minimum levels of health, nutrition, sanitation, shelter and security
•
• minimal capacities, including literacy and physical capacities
20

t self-respect and aspiration
 
t positive freedom or autonomy
 
t liberty
 
t enjoyment
 
t understanding or knowledge
 
t signiﬁcant relations with others and some participation in social life
 
t accomplishment.
Thus, ‘development occurs if and only if there is some overall expansion in human ﬂourishing or 
the quality of human lives or human well-being consistent with the demands of social justice and 
freedom’ (Qizilbash, 1996).
The new focus and stress on the ethical dimension of development, and the entitlements and 
capabilities of people (and ultimately freedom), is a natural switch in development thinking away 
from growth maximization to concern with the structure of production and consumption and 
distribution of income. As far as entitlements are concerned, Sen’s dissent is that income is often 
a very inadequate measure, which he tries to illustrate with reference to the incidence of famines

In conclusion, therefore, and in answer to the question: ‘Development for what?’, we can say 
that development has occurred when there has been an improvement in basic needs, when 
economic progress has contributed to a greater sense of self-esteem for the country and indi-
viduals within it, and when material advancement has expanded people’s entitlements, cap-
abilities and freedoms. The fact that many of these ingredients of development are not easily 
measurable does not detract from their importance: the condition of being developed is as much 
a state of mind as a physical condition measurable by economic indices alone. For an illuminating

According to the World Bank and the organization Social Progress Initiative, Costa Rica 
is, in many respects, a development success story. It is classified as an upper-middle in-
come country with a per capita income of $13,000 in 2014, and has experienced steady 
economic expansion over the past 25 years or so. The country pursues a strategy of 
outward-oriented, export-led growth, and the attraction of foreign direct investment.
More importantly, it attempts to spread economic and social progress as widely 
as possible among its 5 million inhabitants. According to the Social Progress Index for 
2015, calculated by the Social Progress Initiative based in Washington DC, Costa Rica is 
the country with most social progress relative to income. Among developing countries, 
only Chile and Uruguay rank higher, but both these countries have higher levels of per 
capita income. Costa Rica met six of the eight Millennium Development Goals in 2015. 
The Social Progress Index is based on such factors as: basic human needs; foundations 
of well-being; opportunity; nutrition and medical care; water and sanitation; shelter; 
personal safety; access to basic knowledge and information; personal rights, freedom 
and choice; tolerance and inclusiveness; and economic sustainability. The country 
scores highly on freedom of life choices, tolerance, lack of corruption and health, with 
a life expectancy of 80 years, which is higher than in the USA.
Elementary education has been compulsory since 1869; women in Costa Rica have 
more schooling than men, and the adult literacy rate is close to 100%. A welfare state 
was created in 1941. Democracy was established in 1948 and the army was abolished at 
the same time, saving millions of dollars on the military. Costa Rica’s social expenditure 
on education and health is over 20% of GDP, much higher than the Latin American 
average. There is still some poverty, particularly among those of African descent, but 
attempts are being made to redress this inequality. The country takes seriously the 
public provision of leisure facilities and gives priority to the environment. The Happy 
Planet Index, constructed by the New Economics Foundation, ranks Costa Rica as the 
top country based on measures of subjective well-being, life expectancy and ecological 
footprint (care of the environment).
The country has moved close in recent years to the true meaning of development 
as defined by Goulet and Sen. Development is not just about a rise in the average level 
of per capita income; it is about the expansion of entitlements and capabilities, and 
ultimately personal freedom.
Case example 1.1
Costa Rica: developing in the right way
distinctive and because of this the subject has developed its own modus vivendi (way of doing 
things), although drawing liberally on economic theory, as do other branches of economics.
If it is to be useful, however, a great deal of conventional economic theory must be adapted to 
suit the conditions prevailing in developing countries, and many of the assumptions that underlie 
conventional economic models have to be modified, if not abandoned, if they are to yield fruitful 
insights into the development process. Static equilibrium theory, for example, is ill-suited to the 
analysis of growth and change and of growing inequalities in the distribution of income between 
individuals and countries. It is probably also true, as Todaro and Smith (2015) strongly argue, that 
economics needs to be viewed in the much broader perspective of the overall social system of a 
country (which includes values, beliefs, attitudes towards effort and risk-taking, religion and the 
class system) if development mistakes are to be avoided that stem from implementing policy 
based on pure economic theory alone.

The perpetuation of underdevelopment
The study of economic development helps us to understand the nature and causes of poverty in 
low-income countries, and the transformation of societies from being primarily rural to primarily 
industrial, with the vast bulk of resources utilized in industrial activities and in service activities 
that serve the industrial sector. But why have some countries hardly participated in this process 
or have been left behind? The first Industrial Revolution gave the present developed countries an 
initial advantage, which they then sustained through the existence of various cumulative forces 
against those left behind (see Chang, 2002; Reinert, 2007). Since the 1960s, there has been a sec-
ond industrial revolution, which has propelled the so-called ‘newly industrialized countries’ of 
Southeast Asia and Latin America into industrialized states, and many others into semi-industri-
alized states. But many countries, particularly in Africa, are still left behind in a semi-feudal state, 
including the very poorest, which have now become the prime focus of concern of the World 
Bank and other development agencies.
There are many theories of the perpetuation of underdevelopment but none seems to have 
universal validity. The condition of agriculture is of foremost importance. It was, first of all, settled 
agriculture that laid the basis for the great civilizations of the past, and it was the increase in agri-
cultural productivity in England in the eighteenth century that laid the basis for, and sustained, 
the first Industrial Revolution. If there is one overriding factor that explains why some countries 
developed before others, and why some countries are still backward without a significant indus-
trial sector, it lies in the condition of agriculture, which, in the early stages of development, is the 
sector that must release factors of production for other activities and provide the purchasing 
power over industrial goods (see Chapter 5).
The condition of agriculture depends on many factors, institutional as well as economic, 
and physical conditions are also of key importance. Climate particularly affects the conditions 
of production. Heat debilitates human beings. Extremes of heat and humidity also reduce 
the quality of the soil and contribute to the low productivity of certain crops. It cannot be a 
co­
incidence that almost all developing countries are situated in tropical or subtropical climatic 
regions and that development ‘took off’ in the temperate zones. The condition of agriculture 
has not been helped by what Lipton (1977) called ‘urban bias’, which in many countries has 
starved agriculture of resources. This has happened because ruling elites generally originate 
from, or identify with, the non-rural environment, and because policy-makers have been led 
astray both by empirical evidence that shows a high correlation between levels of development 
and industrialization, and by early development models that stressed investment in industry.
Many other internal conditions have acted as barriers to progress in poor countries; barriers 
that interacted in a vicious circle. In some countries, population size and growth presents a prob-
lem, combined with low levels of human capital formation. The latter in turn perpetuates poverty, 
which is associated with high birth rates and large family size. This is a form of ‘accommodation 
to poverty’ (Galbraith, 1980), which then perpetuates low living standards in a circular process. 
Other countries may lack the psychological conditions required for modernization, built on indi-
vidualism and the competitive spirit, coupled with a strong work ethic, rationalism and scientific 
thought, which characterized the Industrial Revolutions of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century 
Europe, and which played a large part in the emergence of the newly industrialized Southeast 
Asian countries in the latter half of the twentieth century.
External relations between countries also play a part in the process of poverty perpetuation, 
and this has given rise to structuralist and dependency theories of underdevelopment. It seems 
23
1  •  T H E  S T U D Y  O F  E C O N O M I C  D E V E L O P M E N T
to be the general lesson of history that once one set of countries gains an economic advantage, 
the advantage will be sustained through a process of what Myrdal (1957) has called ‘circular and 
cumulative causation’, working through the media of factor mobility and trade. (For a full discus-
sion, see Chapter 10.) Favoured regions denude the backward regions of capital and skilled labour, 
and they trade in commodities whose characteristics guarantee that the gains from trade accrue 
to them. Colonialism was an extreme form of dependency, and many of the countries exploited 
during the colonial era are still poor today. On the other hand, a number of countries that were 
never colonized, such as Ethiopia and Thailand, are equally backward.
Dependence can take more subtle forms, however, based on the international division of 
labour, for example, which leads to unequal exchange relations between rich and poor, with the 
poor dependent on the rich for capital and technology to equip their industrial sectors. The cur-
rent indebtedness of the less developed countries, and the ‘increasing price’ they have to pay 
for development inputs, relative to the price they receive for their exports, are, in the long run, 
manifestations of this dependency. There are exceptions to the thesis of ‘circular and cumulative 
causation’, but in most cases it requires a strong exogenous shock to break out of a vicious circle 
of poverty and dependency.
Some of these issues will be discussed in Part 3 of this book, but first, Chapter 2 focuses 
attention on the magnitude of poverty in developing countries and the world distribution of 
income.
Summary
•
• Development economics is a challenging and exciting subdiscipline of economics, which ad-
dresses the fundamental issues of why some countries are poor and others rich, why some 
countries grow faster than others over long periods, and what is the best way to tackle poverty 
in poor countries.
•
• Interest in the progress of nations is not new. It was the fundamental preoccupation of all the 
great classical economists such as Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, John Stuart 
Mill and Karl Marx – but the subject matter of development economics has witnessed a revival 
since the Second World War.
•
• Revival of interest in development economics has been the result of several factors such as: 
increased awareness of world poverty; developing countries asking for a fairer deal from the 
functioning of the world economy; the call for a new international economic order; and the 
increased globalization and interdependence of the world economy. The Millennium Develop-
ment Goals set out explicit targets for poverty reduction, education and health (among other 
things) to be achieved by 2015 and the new Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved by 
2030 do the same.
•
• Economic development means more than a rise in the average level of income per head of a 
country. A definition of economic (and social) development must embrace a variety of goals 
and values that societies strive for, particularly self-esteem and freedom for people based on 
their entitlements and capabilities (to use the terminology of Amartya Sen).
•
• Economic development presents a major challenge to development economists and policy-
makers. This is because there are structural forces at work within countries and in the world 
economy, which tend to perpetuate underdevelopment and poverty and cause countries to 
get caught in ‘vicious circles’ related to unequal trade between countries and the dependence 
of poor countries on the rich for aid and investment.
