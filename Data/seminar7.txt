SPEAKER 1
Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing. Yeah, no, it's fine. So for all our students, can you hear the voice now?

SPEAKER 2
All right. No, no, it's fine. Yeah. All right. Uh, so sorry about that one, but, uh, it's just a bit of a beginning. The introduction. And, uh so, uh, what? I did, uh, it just to give you a summary about this, uh, the lecture before we move to the seminar discussion. And these two issues are very much related, uh, in the context of economic development. And I also emphasise that the importance to develop rather than deal with the issues per SE, But it's important to to develop some kind of a framework, the analytical framework within that framework, we can look at those issues. All right, so that's the importance of that one. So for the lectures, I think it is the, uh it's quite extraordinary if you look at the the global, you know, fossil carbon emission, that the charge is actually very extraordinary, right? Because, uh, the the of the carbon emission is very much related. It is very much related to the industrialization in the past couple of 100 years. So therefore, if, for example, follow this kind of a trend if the later commerce continue to those kind of, uh, you know, the the power of industrialization for the same pattern in the past, you can see that emission will be extraordinary. That's why I think the day before yesterday there's a the climate expert was arguing that so perhaps, uh, we have only two years left before we get this right before we are actually, you know, going through it's a very difficult adjustment period. Meaning that is the, uh is actually a pressing issue. It's not issue that we can wait, or we can perhaps, uh, deal with it later on. This is the mentality we had before being developed first and clean up later. So this kind of mentality also very much associated with the with the economic development in the past. But perhaps no longer no longer in the sense that is, uh, you know, as I mentioned, is a very pressing issue to deal with the the climate issue not just for rich country, but also for transition and the developing country as well. So when you have go through these lectures, you will be very kind of aware why that is important. So let me go through some, uh, some issues and, uh, the, uh I think it is what we deal with the climate change, perhaps also the pollution, the environmental degradation. One of the concern is that, uh, you know, we have a very important approach. This is the so called the market based approach, right? In dealing with that issue market. Well, if it is a market is a perfect we can, we can do it through market means. But we know the market are not perfect, right? So therefore, what has what is the important concept in this regard in relation to to the role of a market in dealing with those kind of challenging issues? in the lectures. That's the main concept. Anyone from online students. Very important concept. Sorry. Market failure, right? In what form? You are right. It is a market failure. But the market failure is based on the concept. Let me tell you the externality, right is the externalities, the existence of externality, which actually perhaps, uh, you know, symbolised the the market failure. So, with the existence of a market failure in the way, that means, uh, you will have to rectify those market failure so externality can be taken in two forms, right? One thing is a positive positive. Optionality example. Education. Right. Negative. Externality is the pollution right? So positive externality tend to be under supplied. So therefore, government need to support or subsidise education. Like all governments are doing right. The externality, the negative one tend to be oversupplied, right? So therefore they have to be recti rectified through all means. Right? But the best way of dealing with that externality the best way is actually through again the market oriented approach. So, among the list of the full policy, you know, responses, tax and other there's a one thing is about, uh, the the pollution right the permit and the marketable permit, which is the market means. So when you have a developed the, uh, those kind of a carbon market and through those kind of adjustment, what we can do by doing so, we can internalise those externalities through market means. So in theory, perhaps that is the most efficient and most effective means of doing that one. But however, we know that there's so much obstacles, right, and so much, uh, constraints on the developing of those market. They are operating in Europe and Australia and China and other countries. But they need to be fully developed in a way. So therefore, in the transition period, we can see that it's so important for government to step in, right? So what? Tax regulation and those kind of things. And so So that's the way of dealing with the externalities. And, uh so there are certain, uh, the policy, uh, discussions as well. So, very importantly, another concept associated with the analytical approach towards you know, the, uh the, uh, the climate change. So what is that? In order to develop the market, what do you need to do? Market is based on what pricing right pricing goes all factor of production depends on what depends on the market's assessment of the value right, those value of those goods and the value of the factor of production, meaning you have to have a you have to have a price price reflect those value, right? If it is a perfect market, that value can be reflected through pricing. When the prices are working, that the price can guide the, you know, the behaviour of consumers and also the producers. We are doing in a in a most optimal way for doing that one. But when we come to the environmental issues right, we also see that the most effective way is to internalise at the super market means that therefore we need what we also need a value, right? So we need an environment, define the environmental values. So that's why in the lecture, we also introduced the environmental value, how to approach or political economical values on the environmental effects or taking that into account into economic decision making of those values. So this is the point why we don't have a, uh, environmental value. How come we can come up with the, you know, the, uh, the, uh the B means of dealing with those issues, so we can't. So that's the That's the challenge. But however, you know, measuring those value is a real challenge right now. So therefore, there's an ad hoc approach. There is also the, uh, the so called the cost benefit analysis. We used to have this, uh, course offered at the Crawford School. And, uh, but, uh, no longer now, because, uh, you know, the staff is, uh, left And, uh, but, uh, perhaps, uh, down the track, we we we need to, you know, to, uh, reopen that course the cost benefit analysis in terms of policy issues. For example, if you do any project right now, you want to get funding from a bank, right and the bank will have a one requirement, which is about environmental assessment, a proposal, any project. Now you have to have that one so conceptually when we get this, uh, you know, market, the challenging issue, the market, but also the value issues we can see you can You can somehow handle those kind of requirement rather easily. But without that one, you know? No way. I think the most banks now imposing those kind of, uh, that this kind of required for the borrowers to make it a set that career. So thinking about the environmental values is also very important. But also, you know, there's another concept, uh, down the track in the in. This lecture is very much related. What is that? This is the environmental value, right? And then another concept, conceptually very important, but in practical term, very difficult to contemplate those kind of things. Let me tell you, this is the natural capital natural capital. Remember, in lecture one or similar one when we go through that chart, right, we see the capital. The concept of a capital are changing right, from a physical capital to human capital to social capital. Excellent. Two towards kind of a natural capital. Social capital is the concept which incorporate you know, perhaps, uh, many things, right. If you learn the course of institution economic, we know you know how and why the social capital are such an important role. But eventually we have a natural capital. Why we have a natural capital and why that is important again. This is a related another concept in the lecture Can anyone link that one? The natural capital to the concept we learn in this course. If you can view this link, it's pretty good. Can anyone link that one? Link up this. Why have we bother about the natural capital? Because you want to preserve the environment, right? Because when you have an environmental value in the form of a natural capital, that's the way. If you don't have that one, it doesn't matter, you know. You you you you know you pollute, you know, environmental damages and all going on. But without really thinking about the conceptual framework in looking at how and why the damage is is bad. It's bad not just for the current generation already hinting you now, but also for the future generation, right? The intergenerational consideration become a very important in this concept. So can you link? I said no. If you do build the link, it's actually very good to digest this lecture. Let me repeat the question Why really the natural capital and how the natural capital, that concept linking back to the development, I get it right. But I think it is very important anywhere from online students.

SPEAKER 3
Could it also be like the resource curse.

SPEAKER 2
OK, anyone else like to do? Excellent. That is the That's the point because the concept of a sustainable development is very much related to previously. We saw this. You know, we we need a resources to develop. So therefore, when we have a finite supply of resources like a minerals, oil, coal and etcetera, we have a problem because they are finite in supply. So therefore we cannot just forever develop utilising those resources. That's the one sustainability, right? But now, when we added the environmental concern, that's the same thing because we cannot do too much in damaging the environment because, well, you know, this is the theory right where you have this too much damage and beyond some kind of a limit. Right? So, uh, perhaps we cannot one bike, those kind of the trend that means cannot be rectified. That is what affects the future generations. So that's why in this lecture we presented the two views right? Strong sustainability view and weak sustainability view. So the question you are very right, you know? Is it related to sustainability? All right, the strong one. See that? You know, if we have a set of natural capital that capital in total should be by all means should be preserved. OK, it should be preserved. So therefore, you have to find the means of doing that one. But there's also weak sustainability view. That means that yeah, you know, there are certain flexibility of doing that one. In any case, that was a sustainability in the environmental. This kind of a concern is about, uh, the current generation of people they benefit through economic development. But those of gains for the current generation cannot be achieved at the expense of future generations. All right, so in that sense, we can link this environmental concern in the context of the development. Very well. With the sustainability the concept, right. Remember, again refer to the chart we had in the very first lecture about, uh, the goal right of development, right? GDP GDP per capita and, uh, you know, human development, et cetera. Eventually, the goal is about a sustainable development. At that time. The sustainable development is rather weak, right? It can be sustained, of course. Yeah, but now we have a We have a two dimension in understanding. That is sustainability. One thing is about the resources, the financing, we can use it. That's why you know, in the in the lecture we mentioned about the Jeffrey Sachs, his view about how to do it right and a new form of energy, energy efficiency and and and et cetera through technology and et cetera, We can, you know, absorb that another one is the environmental concern, and that can still become more and more important. And nowadays, right, why it is important. Is it because I think in the in the seminars, uh, discussion, I will focus on those issues. And, uh so let me just jump it to to look at the, uh the one important issue. And the men perhaps, uh, is to link economic growth and development with the the environmental. So what is the relationship? I think probably this is the key issue in the lecture in this lecture talking about, uh, the relationship between economic development and the environment. So what sort of approach? We can look at that one using a chart. I can give you a hint. That's right. We're using environmental the invert in inverted environmental cus curve. This has become a very popular originally, as I mentioned earlier, that is to refer to income inequality. But it's a very handy to use that one as a way to describe what happened in the relationship between development and the environment. So basically, pollution environment is worsening when economic development, right? But when the per capita income reach a certain level that can be picked and after that is, you know, is going to a kind of improvement that's in many countries, case right for rich country now example is that when I when I, uh, studied in my master degree in Japan, you know, back to many, many years ago. In fact, I went back in January to say the old university, that is the, uh from, uh, NGA, and, uh, back to 19 fifties people you know, died. So many died by eating the fish caught in the near sea near near sea because the, uh the pollution the mercury, the pollution polluting the sea is terrible. Uh uh, the incident that was reflected those kind of, uh, the changes. And, uh, but now you can You travel in other places very clean, right? It's all being, uh, it just gone through that way. So the environmental christening curve, you can see it coming down and continue to improve. But however, this is also linked to another very important point in the lecture. Can anyone link this one to the economic development? Rich country improved right? Because the technology, the face of development or the stages of development allow them to produce a more high value added less pollution intensive goods. But what happened to those schools, at least in the traditional, uh, pattern of industrialization? What happened to those, uh, of production? Excellent. That's the point. Those facilities that production shifting towards the less developing country, right? Why they are doing that one. Because once you have developed, this is the section of the curve reaching towards the peak. And after being picked, it is very much reflecting to the rising of a middle class demanding for a good environment. So therefore, government have to respond to those kind of a demand by changing the regulation institution and so therefore very difficult, right? All through the, you know, tax and other policy so very difficult for the firm to continue to pollute in the rich country. Right? So they shift to those industry to the less developed country. Precisely so by doing so for less developing country. They have their own priority pollution and the environment is less concern for them. The most concern for them is what obviously that's right. Growth income, right? That's their concern. So therefore, they have a very much lacking this kind of a regulation less stringent regulation. So this is a so called the risk to bottom for developing country. They try to lower the environmental requirement, the regulation lower and lower. To be able to become a more attractive to FD, I so reach to bottom. That's kind of a phenomenon, right? And, uh, so by doing so, we developed country solved their environmental issue, right? But however, you know, we didn't have a very much improvement because what? Because the pollution just moving from one country to another and, uh, so so globally. No hope, no hope. So there's a one slice in this lecture talking about that phenomenon, which is about what can anyone remember? There's one slice in the lecture. Is is what that's describing this kind of a phenomenon Developed country move. Those, uh, shifting those, uh, there's actually AAA. Sorry, yes is the carbon leakage in the lecture, So it's leaked. There's a I think it's a long ago. There's a scholar coming to a U presenting There's actually technology from satellite right to capture the, uh, the pollution. The dark crowd actually moving. It is actually moving. And so those kind of phenomena so globally we said this the environmental concern is a global challenge. It's not a challenge for rich country or poor country. It's a one challenge for all. So therefore, it won't solve the problem. So therefore, II, I think the lecture mentioned about the WTO I It won't you know, uh, work in a way. But we also mentioned in the today's seminar about the concept of, uh, of, uh of the the, uh, Collab and, uh, in the context of, uh in discussing of those, uh, the current international current international arrangement, like the Kyoto Protocol Paris agreement, all this and why they are not working effectively. They are tackling the global thing, but they are not working effectively. So this is the topic. We are going to to talk, uh, shortly. OK, so that's, uh, the environmental uh uh, issue natural capital, intergenerational consideration. And, uh, environmental value is related. Another important concept, which is the equity, right? The equity is not just, uh you know, at the current is the equity across the different generations. So, uh, people should behave in a in a way that would be responsible for the future generations. Right? And this is actually very, very responsible way for doing that. One. The worst thing that is, the current generation benefit from economic gains, right. But somehow, to a great extent at the expense of the future generation, that's equity issue. Right? So su, uh, sustainability, uh, is issue, uh, won't go through those theory. Those are optimistic view. And this is a pessimistic view, right? We mentioned about the Thomas Mars, right? About the population we mentioned about the first time in the lecture about the William Stanley Js, right? Very famous economy. And, uh, he published the book. They call it the coal Book. Right? Saying that No, great Britain, you know, running through industrialization, but saying that warning I think it's 1860 warning. You know, England is run out of coal, so actually cost are very scarce, right? About those kinds of industrialization. Uh, uh, but he actually, he's a very, uh, very sad. He, uh he, uh he he he moved to Australia, I think the swimming at the beach, he actually drowned, and he he died from, uh, swimming there in front of his family. And, uh, it's a very sad story about this, uh, economy, but he's very, very known for that one. The third one is the collab of Rome. And, uh, have you heard about that one? The limit of growth, published in 1972. And, uh, those, uh, collapse of Rome. And are we aware of this environmental concern? And the six of them initiate, uh, make the init initiation and including my supervisor, uh, back to, uh uh uh International University of Japan. And this time, II. I met the president of university and in his office. You can still see that the former President soo ok up his, uh, his picture and, uh, to bring back a lot of memories about a study there. Anyway, he's one of the the founders of co of role, and, uh, but again, it's very controversial. I can talk about that idea a lot, but we don't have much time, but, uh, the idea is very simple. We we have to have a balanced growth, basically, like the fertility rate is actually equal to death rate. So maintain the population rather than, you know, have an explosion increase of the population or the capital. You know, depreciation rate with the interest rate is actually the same thing. You don't have a very much industrial expansion, rather rather maintaining some kind of, uh, but again, people criticising those kind of views and know where we can generate income right where we can, you know, have those income revenues to solve the problem of poverty. So again, it's a very controversial, and this is the back to 19 seventies, right? But now you can see after another. Well, this half century has been passed, right? So therefore people now have a consciousness about those development. This is very much related to the following, uh, ideas. It's about a green growth. The green GDP, the green growth and the seeing. Basically, all the new ecosystem new ecosystem is all very new now, but it's a very important concept. So meaning that, uh, I was attending a conference at the, uh, the teaching break, uh, in Beijing, the conference I was presenting, uh, the, uh, the paper on the modern entrepreneurship. Right. So attract a lot of attention because because if you want to attack the environmental issue, the concern basically, we have to radically change the so called the traditional or old business model. You have to do that one all. The model, the business model won't work in the new context. But in order to change that one, there's so much requirement, so much things have to be changed. So in this lecture, I think that made us think is very importantly, what needs to be done from a consumer's point of view, from a producer's point of view as well as the government point of view, you know what we need to do? We ask those questions. So in that sense, I think this lecture is very important. It's different from the traditional economic lectures for economic development, because at that time we don't have very much about this dimension at all. Basically GDP right capital accumulation investment. We don't really pay a very much a due attention to the environmental concern, but now it's a different story and again this year is a crucial year. We mentioned about the financing and, uh, the UN initiative. Carbon leakage has been done, And, uh, this year the cop 29 is will be held in Kazakhstan, right? Oh, no, no, not Kazakhstan. Azer Azerbaijan in Azerbaijan in, uh, Central Asia And in November, Very important. This is a crucial year. Why is so crucial the team now the people are working. I know someone there who are working very intensively to secure the arrangement for the financing. Financing. Uh, I will give you the numbers in a in a similar discussion. How much we need you Guess how much we need. And where did the money can come from? How we can, you know, organise or arrange those kind of the fund and the use of that fund, etcetera. So it's a massive before cop 29 there is a massive negotiation going on among the members of the country. Nearly 201 190 countries evolve in those kind of discussion and, uh, just happened, uh, last week, but also next week in Colombia, the meeting continues, and, uh and and in Bonn, in Germany in June, so All these things are being part of that effort anyway. So the again the green growth, the concept of a green growth become a very important. Uh, I think perhaps it's also highlighting conceptually what sort of, uh, you know, approach, right? It's not a very developed in a way, and including the concept of a collab I'm going to talk about shortly for those issues are still very much developing. So I hope that through this lecture, student will be aware of the importance of the issue in the context of development. But also, I would like to encourage you. There's a three questions three or four questions here, but in tutorial, but also three questions in a seminar we are going to discuss in a second hour. So those are the issue, I think for the for the students, right, The younger generation is so important because that affects the affects the you know, the current and the future generations. And, uh, so some issue you need to be, uh, uh, uh uh aware of And, uh, so sustainability, green growth, but a role of a public policy. And, uh So, for example, you know too often those entrusted with the shaping economic policy have put too little attention on the consequences of the policies for natural resources and the environment and devoted even less attention to shaping policies that might actually improve the quality of the environment and the resource management management. Joseph Series. I quoted that one in the last page of the lecture. So that's the summary. So it took a bit of two more time anyway. So any question about that one, I think the important is just to connect, right? Let's just like just what I did. You connect the concept, they're all connected when you connected. You can digest this lecture very well. All right. For those students who already listen to the recorded lecture, I can tell, you know if if I'm answering the question, But for those who haven't PD two right, so that would be good for the digest. Uh, those, uh, lecture the con any Any question. All right. So, uh, in that case, perhaps we can, uh, Now, let's come back to the seminars topic and then related to case study and, uh, very much related. So let me go through some of the the slides, right Now, the key question remember, refer back to the C is inverted Eve. Right? So if you have that pattern being demonstrated, if you are a country which has a less less developed less income per capital, do you want to do it to deal with that environmental issue or not? Many countries have the things and no need the important things to develop the economy. Right? So when the income per cap income increases automatically, those kinds of adjustment, they will take place. So therefore we can solve the problem. But that's the key question why developing countries are the key to climate action. They are the majority, by the way. Right. And the majority of the people majority of the, uh you know, those, uh, the countries. And so therefore, whether those countries are doing it or not, you know, we hold the key for the success of, uh, of this, uh, very broad. Uh uh uh, goal of, uh, uh, mitigation, uh, environmental improvement. So developing countries will be the most severely affected by accelerating climate change. So they are actually you cannot just wait there because the countries are being affected, even excluding China from the calculation are likely to emit more than half of the annual global total greenhouse gas emission as early as 2030. It excluded why China is the largest polluter, the emitter in the whole world. What's the percentage of China emitting in the total emission globally? What's the percentage? Anyone has a guess? 30%. It is about 17% 17% which is huge is the second largest economy in the world, but also at the stage of rapid industrialization. Meaning what? At that stage, you have a very energy intensive, carbon intensive and, uh, basically pollution intensive state of development. It is now phasing out a lot of the industry, but continue to be the case. Always remember the carbon leakage we have just mentioned right? For example, China has a very stringent regulation on environment. So therefore, fs that behave by the shift industry offshore, it won't solve the problem. But anyway, the key message here that a developing country are themselves being affected. But international community has not focused sufficiently on the range of development, adaptation and resilience, priorities and the constraint those countries face in tackling the worst interwoven emission mitigation priority. So not yet let's not doing that one. But again, we are facing the traditional challenges of development. Right? All these things we mentioned in the past lecture, but now added another dimension. That means those approach you have to take into account about the environmental dimension. That's the challenge, right? So now so why the the existing one is not a very effective Why are the current architecture Kyoto Protocol You mentioned Paris agreement. Basically, Why is the prison as a dilemma of climate change, happen? But also importantly, is another concept which is a free riding, you know, free riding, right. They play such an important role in wakening agreement on the global public goods. Free riding means what? When? When certain countries in the world made a commitment to adaptation and emission reduction and etcetera. But other countries see that? No, You know, we can just, uh, you know, write it down and, uh, wait until a bit later on. So let others take the responsibility, but we won't do it because we have our own priority. But again, this kind of thinking is very popular in the developing country. Free writing. That's weaken. Weaken Those. Uh Uh uh uh. uh, the the agreement, the existing one. Why does the world community need a economic? This is I'll come to that. But this is by, uh, uh, Nobel. Lauren, uh, economics and proposing those kind of idea. And how does the idea of economic apply to developing country? So that's the issue, right? Basically, very briefly about those things. The protocol, you know, Kyoto is very nice. Conceptually Paris agreement. Also very nice, conceptually, but there is no binding international agreement on climate change. That means that you every country made some kind of a commitment, but it's not a bonding, right? So therefore, if you won't make that commitment in practise, there is no penalties, right? There is no punishment. You don't have to pay the price. So by doing so the phenomenon of a free riding where we there, Right. And, uh, so agreement on the climate public goods are hard because individual countries have an incentive to defect, producing a non cooperating back seat neighbours outcome, which is basically the prisoner dilemma. What is the prisoner dilemma? This is many of the thorniest global issues. Have the structure of the prison dilemma basically very simple that occur the dilemma occurs in a strategic situation in which the actors countries right players have incentive to make themselves better off at the expense of other parties, right? The result is that all parties are worse off. That's a typical thing you try to be. You make yourself better off at the expense of others. But in the end, everyone, uh, was off. So this is applied to the climate change, right? If you don't do it, let others do. You seem to be gaining something right, because the extra cost will be involved in dealing with that economic change. So therefore you can see well, we by not doing it, we can save some money, right? But however, because everyone you play that sort of game, you can see everyone was so so in a way. And this is actually happening right now in the international politics, in the in this kind of a concern. Now why? You know free riding play important role. The free riding occurs when the party receives the benefit of the public goods. There's a public goods right, without contributing to the cost. Right. So you enjoy. If other countries doing that one, we can see there's certain improvement to the environment, right? So we benefit from that one. But we don't pay any cost or contribution for those kind of a mitigation effort. So by doing so, we free right, we free, right? So this one was for those countries who made a commitment and delivered policies, etcetera. So what they do is that no, it's not fair. How come they let us to shoulder the burden of doing so while others are not doing it so that they weaken their determination for doing it? So the international consensus will become a very important This is actually part of the negotiation to justify or to get a message across to those later crime, saying that you actually in your interest for doing so, right? So don't free right those kind of a concern. So in the case of in the case of the international climate change policy, countries have an incentive to rely on the emission reduction of others. Right? Perhaps you can see naturally, you know, for the developing country, right, without making costly domestic reduction, themselves can be costly for those kind of adjustment. So therefore, we don't really have a you know, those, uh, consensus right? Very difficult for them to make those conditions. So basically two preconditions for developing countries to get involved. Number one is the finance we already mentioned. Number two is the technical support. So both are very important. And I give you the numbers, the money, the finance are needed on annual basis. We are more than $2 trillion every year, at least in the next seven years, right to go through this difficult adjustment stage, but again, that's come later. So free riding is a major hurdle to addressing global externality. Now we know it, right global externality. And it lies at the heart of the failure to deal with the climate change. Everyone has free, right? Right. And, uh, we don't really make a serious commitment. But now, developing countries said, Well, the atmosphere, you know, those are carbon being tracked in the atmosphere is due to develop the country in the past, but now is our You cannot deprive the opportunity for us to develop, but for the responsibility for the, you know, for the for the problem, uh, being caused by developed country in the past. So those kind of mentality is also very popular. So that makes some precondition, as I just mentioned even harder, right? And, uh so that means that, you know, you got that have put in place to be able to Peru those later commerce to make those commitments. Otherwise, the free riding those phenomena will continue to be around. Making the global efforts for doing so will become a very difficult now climbing club. This is the I think Let me just Oh, sorry

SPEAKER 4
where? He said what?

SPEAKER 2
Well, I see. I see slowly. This is the, uh, the the William N house. He got an over price and, uh, in, uh, on climate change. That is the article on foreign affairs and about Climate Club and how to fix the fing global effort. So, uh, for those students who really want to go in deeper into those ideas, you can read that. I read that one, and I feel that it's quite appealing in a way, but on the practical terms will be very difficult to implement. OK, so we can This is the reference. Very Yeah. We talk about a free riding right now. Why does the work community need a club right. So basically, participating country would agree to undertake a harmonised emission reduction designed to meet the climate objective. Nations that do not participate or do not meet their obligation would incur penalties. That means, uh, yes. If you if you do it or not do it. I make a big difference in terms of this, uh, reward and also the penalty. So the key to effective climate treaty is to change the architecture from a voluntary agreement to the one with a strong incentive to participate. That means that if you don't participate sorry, you have to pay part. The certain price make It is a very harsh right And, uh, but again, setting up those kind of a binding commitment, uh, in practical terms is also very difficult, in a way. Ideal ideal. Uh uh. Thinking now, how does the idea of this apply to developing countries? That's a challenge. The level of development, the different priority. As we mentioned contribution to emission by development country in the past as we mentioned cost of climate change to developing countries so added cost. So that's why the financing is important. Climate financing, tackling the support. This is the condition for joining the collapse, right? So make things more complex. And how does the idea of climate change Oh, sorry. Here, let's go further. Why do developing cancer really need at the moment that the momentum has been growing? You know, for the World Bank out other powerful global or regional financial institution to change their lending practise so that the less wealthy nations can afford to harden themselves against the rising seas, worsen the storm and other extreme of climate change. So developing nations also need help with a big investment it would take to move their economies away from a climate damaging coal and petroleum. So those are the things, you know, still concerned. Uh, those country here is a very important issue. I want you to link the one we have. Uh, we just mentioned in the lecture about those, uh, green growth, the fundamental change of a business in the model and the eco eco building the eco system. So all these things are related to the way that the industrialization taking place now we can actually divide it into, perhaps up to now, as in the past, we can see that the traditional industrialization right And as I mentioned, perhaps no hope will continue to pollute and clean up later because they won't able to achieve the global objective of climate change. You know, mitigation, etcetera. So I have to do their share. Overcoming those difficulties of prisoners dilemma, the free riding, those kind of a concern and for doing so. But, however, there's a huge challenge for the later crime to alter the way that the industrialization taking place in the policy maker their mind. In the players like entrepreneurs, they are still believing most of the cases right is the traditional way of industrialization. Capital accumulation, as we mentioned repeatedly, is so important and, uh, producing the goods, which perhaps according to your own underlying comparative advantage, make it is the more profitable and trading those goods globally. Those things is still. But now, in a very fundamental way, those kind of mentality has to be changed. How that's the challenge. So I think, for economy students thinking about that way, finding a way about adjustment, what sort of adjustment are needed? I'm part of the consumers are part of the consumers. What sort of a consciousness right? The behaviour changes. What sort of institutional changes are needed and to make people to think that is the right way to do. I'll give you one example if the producers are producing the green product. We mentioned about the concept of green GDP per green product because of the extra cost at the moment at this stage, so the costs can be higher than the goods of the normal goods. What do you do for consumers? Guess what they prefer to buy, the cheaper the traditional goods or they prefer to buy the green groups of products with the premium price. Which one you you buy, as I noticed last something

SPEAKER 4
which is great. And even though even though without, like the some sometimes disregardless of the, um, the price No, no, no.

SPEAKER 2
Let me just emphasise my point. It's not that kind of issue. Similar products but the green products with the traditional product right? But the green product is a premium means at this stage. It are more expensive if the consumers, the traditional macroeconomist, tell us what do you do? You consumers always go with a cheap price. That's natural, because by doing so, you can somehow maximise your utility in a way. But now the seas are changing. We have a very grand objective of climate change. We need a fundamental change of a business model, right, as I mentioned. So by doing so, everything has to be changed. Including consumer and the behaviour of consciousness Consciousness become very important in the sense. In fact, there are some studies show consumers nowadays actually prefer paying the premium of green products rather than the traditional. It actually have evidence to show that way. That means again. It actually challenge the traditional series in a way, for the council preneurs the entrepreneurs, they have also the motivation in producing through eco technology the Mo most innovation one and to produce those green product, which is a related lecture. The green growth in a way is happening. But they need a need, a kind of a framework. Right? So please refer to the article I I put on the water on the modern entrepreneurship, and, uh, I, uh, co-author with, uh, one of the PhD students. And, uh uh, it is from Indonesia we published last year. And, uh, so in that article, we mentioning about those all these things being mentioned when I presenting in different universities and, uh, some, you know, very traditional theories. Theories about those, Uh uh, Macroeconomic. They were saying that Actually, there's so much opportunity for us to actually explore. Those are the radical underpinning about those new ideas and perhaps also match that one with the empirical test to see whether the consumer consciousness why the consciousness is so important. Because what because through education and and information, people aware of climate change is a real issue. So when the consciousness are there behaviour or change And for those students who learn the institution economic, you know why How we can connect that one and, uh, with with outcome anyway or just extend it a bit about this? What? What's the need to be done? And, uh, yeah, that's, uh, that's another one. Now let's back to the critical issue. The climate financing. So looking ahead, advocates of a free, far more climate funding for countries primarily in the Southern Hemisphere worry no one is putting together a big, tough plan that will turn the landing reform talk into action. They are doing that, and it's not just the lending from the banks. Have you heard about the bond, the grain bond issuing by corporate bond. Treasury bond they all. Somehow, I think coal probably affected a bit, but the overall trend is increasing and meaning what? When you issue corporate bond the green bond, that means the protection. The whole design of the production is actually very much related to green growth. Otherwise, you you know, you you compromise. It's not a green bond, so therefore the company have a motivation and to do so. But those market the bond market need to be fully development with the with the the the the support of a public policy, for example, but also regulatory change for doing that well Now. World Bank estimated that developing countries would need $2.4 trillion in both the public and the private fund each year for the next seven years to deal with the climate change, pandemics and the conflict. That's not just the, uh, uh, climate change, but including everything. But that's a substantial amount of money And the question Now, in fact, let's look at what happened to cop 29 and I was told that, uh, they they really want to make a breakthrough the breakthrough this year is crucial, but if not, it will be very difficult to drag out with is always a very hard negotiation. And but eventually perhaps, uh will be, uh, successful. But, uh, but in doing so, it is actually quite difficult now changes the perspective on part of the developing country, so developing country also need to change. All right. So there is a new understanding that an integrated climate and development programme can simultaneously speed up development and lower greenhouse gas emission if implemented at a scale that's promising that actually that actually somehow change the the inverted environment environment. You you curve right. The U curve indicate that now you have to have a certain level of income to be able to tackle the climate change pollution, for example. But now the new study or understanding that no development and climate change mitigation can happen at the same time. But the challenge is that you have to have a larger scale in implementing those kind of a strategy, and those larger scale is need international Cooper operation and that corporation need to get involved of both rich and poor country to be able to create that scale, so now you can see what we at at stake. So when we talk about this issue at the moment, we can see the challenges ahead, but also kind of a shed, some light on the on the way forward. That means it can be done. It can be done so investment and innovation in adaptation resilience, nature in emission mitigation can be in each country's natural national self interest if they boost economic growth while providing cheaper and more inclusive access to modern energy such as the green hydrogen. So it's all developing now, and, uh, and the technology being also increasingly being made available to develop the country. And, uh, But of course, there's a lot of challenges. And the question for today. What are the challenges in the transition to low carbon development model in terms of financing, capacity building and technical assistance, which is very much related to the UN? United Nations global efforts, uh, in negotiation on that one lot of coordinations are needed for doing so. Why does a low carbon development model must concentrate on the green industrialization? That means the traditional, as I mentioned, perhaps, is the one in the past. We cannot repeat. It cannot be repeated unless we forget about the climate change target. If you want to really respect that target or implement that way, those, uh, pattern of indu industrialization has to be changed. How? The new model of growth tap new digital technology to produce the economic activity that is less carbon intensive. This one we didn't mention very much in lecture. We also didn't men mention very much in today's, uh, seminar discussion. But I like to reset the issue because what? Because the digital technology is transforming our industry, our society and our way of life is happening right now. So therefore, how we can tap or develop the tap that resources the digital technology for the mitigation purpose. So I leave that one as an open question, so we can somehow discuss, uh uh, that one. So, uh, let me stop here. So I like, uh, we have a quite a Yeah, a lot Online students. Let's do the same thing. Two year will help to organise the group for online. I think we have, uh, our student, perhaps also maybe divided into two groups. OK, for the for the we have a plenty of time for doing so. So three questions not necessarily going through every single of them but focus on a particular one is also is also OK, so your opportunity as a way of digesting the lectures, the seminars by, you know, the group discussions. And, uh, so that's the whole purpose of, uh, uh, designing for for that one. Of course. On Friday, we resumed the tutorials, and then Nicola and the three year will help you, uh, in discussing that the tutorial question attached to at the end of a lecture notes. All right, OK. Yeah. So, uh, that's a yes.

SPEAKER 5
Like developing countries. They will be worse off because of that, because, like, uh, the developed countries are always the dominators of those organisations of the so they may like to set a very high, uh, criteria for the developing countries. So method that will constrain the growth of the the last people.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah, that's actually a very interesting question. If, for example, developing countries regarding this global efforts as a part of, uh, as a part of a rich countries efforts, right. So they were saying they are setting a very high boss. You are studying a very high bar is very difficult for us to fulfil it. So therefore you can see there's a gap in understanding those, uh, what is required and how to narrow that gap. My quick answer to the question. Very great question. My quick answer to that one is actually part of the negotiation, as I mentioned is going on globally that involving nearly 200 countries. So therefore, I think they can narrow those kind of a gap in understanding. Right? So and again, the precondition are there for developing countries to try to fulfil those kind of, uh, obligation in meeting those requirements. But if you are setting a very low bar, probably it won't help. So hiding as a high bar and trying to make efforts for country to reach those kind of requirements, I think that's the way to go. But that's a great question again, as it can be a part of a group discussion. OK, yeah, one moment.

SPEAKER 6
How high or how low the standard is. So so the country that the member of the country obey or they will commit, they will realise their commitment always realise it, but the the country. They were reluctant to do it, so they will always

SPEAKER 2
bring it up. Yeah, well, this is again. It's not just about a standard, but it's about a priority for those countries seeing that our priority is for economic development. So therefore, no matter what, right. So those countries need to be persuaded in a way and also recognise what is actually at the state and how the economic change affects your own interest, as we mentioned today. So those kind of thinking Anyway, let's have a discussion. And again later on, we can, uh we can, uh we can, uh, uh, discuss in public and we both an online group and in person group. All right, Thanks. You can sus suspend. You can organise that one, but suspend the recording. Thanks All my students.

SPEAKER 1
I will send you to a breakout room. Please take a photo of all these questions and you may find these questions at the end of the slide of seminar.

SPEAKER 4
And, uh, so, uh, I have opened all the breakout

SPEAKER 1
rooms. Please join the room.

SPEAKER 2
Can you? Yeah, that's right. Recording stuff, right? It's I was It is seven gonna be just high

SPEAKER 4
new York each other around the city of E. I it it's a more invasive that Go on. Yeah, the to So what What are the sources of? Well, problem this was so which cause, say, say, for So we got some issues because they need to prioritise

SPEAKER 7
and something else that that's why I Because they cannot predict on over in the first, that's a lot. So there that the car is to Yes, I priority. They have this metaphor like a piece of cake if you divide it with, uh, other other things besides the most important, they will, like be used to, uh, the marginal benefit they could get from medication. I don't know how when it could produce a you know, utility of 80% is to reduce it by making it more fire sustainable. But it's not to or USA can you know.

SPEAKER 4
Yeah, well, everything really did You friends like organisations that

SPEAKER 5
that it should be used in a particular you like to transfer in a low carbon production, just like or by precision.

SPEAKER 7
You come from the you know, the carbon tax. So the the rich country like, um, carbon, right. So they need their countries to preserve their, um, carbon, Uh, like the forest. And they get to to the develop they develop local, could use the money there to, um, the plus finance. No, depend on the risk time.

SPEAKER 4
Let's say even that's how I can the we So So for the entire we are OK, Yeah, is common.

SPEAKER 5
You can subs subs me to which no error theories. That's, uh, some, uh, some part of the industry have to pay for the like carbon codes. Yeah, like, you know, the, uh, SES or like the irons below to pay those money. Two byte code in this market to pay those like, uh uh, they should pay for the car to the like the company that they reduced the emission of alco oxide. So, like I mentioned of the industry, OK, when the

SPEAKER 4
western, the West, no large.

SPEAKER 5
It's a very rough The President Europe. Now, this guy just try to they are trying to do this kind of Oh, yeah, like so I still have to arrive. No, the manager to buy us. So I've been to money. Forests. Was forest in the process emission local music called find?

SPEAKER 4
No, I mean, not here, Cor by few. If we we have to say, I must must present and I'll bring this right. He assumed I Thanks. They're not They're not friends. So it's just, uh you know, this personal that's by each country, OK, after this, but something, in contrast, I don't So so, uh, resource based on common vision problem. Oh, so it's not my but for something like so So I do you mind? So I feel like the industrialization, which is not They must Yeah. Who is in the store? In the industry. Mhm it it No. I mean, yeah, I wish we are her to travel, you know? I mean, at least rather than Oh, why? Oh, but how? How would Because for me, some of the some some of the uh yeah, so So that the so is use the scale the way that no right you can for your B, the the the the the the the mo. Because I'm not extracting it, OK, each step of the way, you know? So we probably holy shit. Uh, I think the great industrialization here, uh, we correlated

SPEAKER 7
a lot with So the visualisation localization probably works But Green Visor will make positive, uh, astronomy to low carbon low magnet. So, um, we can argue that, OK, it's it's not. But we we we need to see that green neutralisation is one or other ways could bring benefit to all. Could bring low emission from a sustainable group. Economic wise, it could be more interesting for the, uh for to product because it will be getting less and less, uh, getting cheaper and cheaper because more wages more, uh, labour will come to the production. And, uh, which become lower while if it's with the lack of green decision, which of green will higher while traditional will will, uh, lower than do this one So more gra more lower wages.

SPEAKER 4
I mean, the problems that we always search for, that we would from like, like, like upgrade upgrading to the brain. Oh, you could say that it is now, don't OK,

SPEAKER 7
so that is how I would And that is where you get. Would it turn into that green industrialization also requiring most of thank you the first question here, So I don't know what that is. It is complicated, and that's why it's yeah, I think

SPEAKER 4
um so OK, high quadrant follows presumption, which is how we categorise the technology that is called services in we categorise that new digital technology in this kind of sense is not first, yes, additional services and video. I feel like there. No, no, it's kind of like shit. Do little on site work to and just, uh, briefly hot tea. The the the I said, As I said, it's the open. It isn't sitting there about why we need to, as I mentioned and maybe not actually, not very new.

SPEAKER 7
You decide now because, uh, those ideas Third question, then

SPEAKER 4
you OK? Why? Yeah, You said OK. Seven this to transform the old. Then you are I How different? CO This is a short time, but why should not exist? Whether we can use this transform is hard to repeat that online itself and they are raising questions.

SPEAKER 7
Knew that. Yeah, Yeah, I I agree. This pain relief that Yeah, yeah, and through a song

SPEAKER 4
is a We should do, um, you can That gives the source and measure them. So So my these appointments What much? More than just the regular an agent concept, because they are really to make some. OK, the motion. We We have the expectation that means that so let's say so. The price, you know, like price to right. Good. Do not count.

SPEAKER 5
Not at all. And no. Ok, ok, right It there.

SPEAKER 4
No way. Ok, if we think that the new model of growth

SPEAKER 7
like people are conscious about it, um, there's a, uh there's a problem here. The device or uh product that produce with, uh, Green is higher than Mr More accessible.

SPEAKER 4
Improve my technique if All right, so they are in

SPEAKER 2
one group, right?

SPEAKER 4
Just get it, get it Recording us.

SPEAKER 2
Go ahead. Excellent. Yeah. So, uh, have you finished on the online discussion? It's OK, one minute. OK, that's good One.

SPEAKER 4
And I take a that the body mhm. You can take OK a lot. Ok, Ok, OK, so I'll put out one so you can OK?

SPEAKER 7
Yeah, feel better, So yeah, thank you so much.

SPEAKER 2
And, uh, from what I observed that there seems to be a discussion is very, very lively. And, uh, let me emphasise that these three questions are all very significant. Question The third one is the more difficult because it's open ended In a way, we don't have a very clear answer to that one. And, uh, but the students raise that question about a third. So perhaps let me, uh, just mention, uh, answer that question very shortly before I invite you to to present. Basically, we need that. A new model of growth. You can call this a new industrialization. You can call this a green growth. You can call this a low carbon growth, whatever. But that strategy, the new model really need a new thinking, a new way of doing business. And what happened right now is that we do have a very rapid growth and the development of digital technology. So digit technology were somehow, as I mentioned, just now, you know, transforming impacting in us business, individual society, perhaps also broadly on the way of industrialization. So I think there's probably two dimension number one. With the new digital technology, new sectors can be created new. Those sectors are less poll pollution intensive and less carbon intensive, perhaps also more energy efficient. Because those technology so technology are new, new sectors can be created or those sectors can have this kind of a this they lose their song again.

SPEAKER 1
This?

SPEAKER 2
Oh, no, it's quite weird.

SPEAKER 1
Hi, honest student, Can you hear the voice?

SPEAKER 8
Yes, we can. Very loud and clear. So maybe you can refresh your system.

SPEAKER 4
Mhm.

SPEAKER 2
OK, that's OK. So, uh, I, I will repeat because it's all recorded. The, uh, basically two things. New technology. Digital technology will create a new sectors. Those sectors will be less carbon intensive for sure. So therefore, if there is a widespread and the technology and, uh, we can see that perhaps to some extent we can transforming the economy by developing a new sector. And, uh and by doing so, you know, the the less carbon intensive development can be achieved. The second invention is that with the digital technology, what we can do is to transform using that technology to transform the existing manufacturing the existing sector. Those, uh, can be regarded as a traditional sector, and, uh, all can be regarded as old sector using old technology and the more carbon intensive and energy inefficient et cetera. So, in the sense, if if the sector can be transformed using the new technology, I'm sure they can. And, uh, and then we can see, uh achieved the same objective, right? So that's the basic thing. And, uh, there's also economy wide economy wide impact of digital technology so that the economy wide of technology impact can actually transform. It's not just the production in a way, but also the consumption. So therefore the consumption is also can be related, right, less carbon intensive consumption bundles and more. As I mentioned, the premium I pay the premium price. But eventually perhaps the green products can be produced more, uh, more cheaply, more economically. That can happen. So that's again. The digital technology can help. So the new model requires a lot of new thinking. So that's the purpose, you know, for you to to to to think about that one. So with that one, let me. Perhaps soon you can organise. We invite an online group to present first. Thanks. Then we can discuss May we have one representative from

SPEAKER 1
our online students to give us the summary of your online discussion. Thank you. Any volunteers from all my students?

SPEAKER 8
Sorry. Um I I thought so. Kna will will share from our from our group that it sounds like her. Her sound is not that great. so I'll make an attempt from our group on the questions. Um, on question one, with regards to the challenge in making, uh, the transition to low carbon development Uh, model, um, our group discussed on the financing. Uh, aspect, um, one was that the mobilising the funds, you know, to support low carbon technology, um can also be difficult, because this is not a global, um, efforts. It depends on each country's, uh, reality, you know, politically at that time, it's, uh, in support of that or not. And on the receiving end for developing countries is the challenge of accessing such funds to to support, you know, uh, that trans to S to support their transition to low carbon development model and on the capacity building side, um, it is noticed from the developing countries, there is often lack of skills. Um, and also institutional capacity, um, or even the technical capacity to design such, um, model, you know, digital and accessing that, um, to to promote that transition. And, uh, one comment that was made, uh, by our team. Um, I'm just reading off on from his, um from his text. He says that, um, for the developing countries. There's limited access to advanced technology and financial resources because those necessary tools and funding, um, would enable the developing countries to implement sustainable practises and even for developing, uh, countries and to incorporate those, uh, digital solutions, um, into the industrial processes. So as a result, those countries were facing those challenges. And can you hear me? Or is it just Sona who couldn't hear me? Oh! Oh, sorry. And so, as a result, uh, they they fall behind in competitiveness and and and struggle as well to meet the international environmental standards. Uh, so that was our response to question one, for question two. thank you for question two. Why must the low carbon development model concentrate on green industrialization? I think you made a point earlier that the reflections on the lecture you provide, um, about you know, that natural capital is, uh, limited. It's not infinite. Um, it it has a limited, um, availability for us to, um receive environmental services from it. And so therefore, the option to move towards green industrial green growth is a sustainable way, um, to to manage our our accessing of, uh, of these natural resources. Um, And so, uh, green industrialization, uh, would encourage innovation. Energy security, Um, supposedly should enhance competitiveness and create jobs. Um, as you shared earlier and on the final question, um, on, uh, how can new model of growth tap to new digital technology and produce economic activity that are less carbon intensive? There are some of the thoughts we shared. Um, you know, on a smart grids, energy system, smart building. You know, we have these, uh um the use of of, um of, um a I in this smart building, um, supposedly to to, uh, control energy. Um, efficiency. How? We, uh, reduce energy usage? Um, even the air conditioning in some housing. You see that it allows for remote work, virtual platforms, uh, reducing our carbon footprint from trans. You know, too much transportation. Air, be it, uh, travel on land. Uh, and therefore, business can still work. Uh, what was the last one? We Yes. And, of course, the, um um I think that was it. Sorry. I think that's that was it that my, uh, group has, uh, shared apologies? Um, you can jump in Isha or Sona, um, or JG. If I missed out anything. Uh, and that's it that I remember for now. Thank you.

SPEAKER 3
I think you've covered everything really well. Um, yeah, I guess we kind of touched on how the political environment sort of needs to be there to transition into that sort of, um, like carbon. And how, um, can you made us think about, like, the incentives? And you were talking about how, um, reframing the narrative towards this cost saving effort? Um, results like it has. It is more likely to be successful rather than talking about, like, I guess, just the moral aspect of it. And then obviously, um, with the for ri effect, if there's anything else that can sort of make it a more, um, binding, um, action in country. Obviously, the issue is that, like, it's a very unequal impact felt and po political cycles of the people who are making the decisions are governed by, like, you know what the voters want and see which are, like, the more things of, like, jobs of, like, are they being displaced? So, um, you know, to build farms and things like that. So, um, just sort of trying to reframe. I guess that urgency on a more person to person level as well. Um, And so I think, um, yeah, uh, also, uh, the new, uh, model of growth, the one about sustainability. Um, also looks at, like, you know, then again, talking about the externality and the cost of engaging and stuff. Obviously, that's prompted a lot of more conversations about OK doing this now. But then, is it sustainable for the economy going forward? Um, and again, the political capital will always be a barrier to that.

SPEAKER 2
Thank you so much. And, uh, can you appear so we can say hello to you? Hello. That's very uh Oh, hi ya. Yeah. So, uh, that's very good summary about the group discussion and, uh, so that that's wonderful. I think among the points you mentioned, there's one important one we mentioned about the economic financing. But you actually mentioning about how and the developing countries themselves can mobilise the finance themselves? That's precisely the topic we are going to deal with next week. All right, so that's why I want to echo. Other point is, is verified in the way. So, uh, I would like you to to thank you for for your contribution is you want to add a few, but very briefly. Yeah, Thanks. Good to see you. Uh, Tari, thank you.

SPEAKER 8
Isha did send, um that, uh, spoke towards the incentive incentivizing transition. So she was, uh, sharing that last point about reframing the information. Yeah, Thanks. Thank you.

SPEAKER 2
Alright. Uh, are you sure you want to add anything or No? Ok, um I mean, yeah, I was just saying that,

SPEAKER 3
like, um, you know, the new growth model of sustainability forces people to think about the future and then forces them to think about like, is there an economic cost of adopting certain models? Um, or using certain fuels carbon intensive fuels. Right now. That would be cheaper for the economy in the long run. So that adds the economic aspect. But the political capital will still continue to be a barrier for a while. And that's a different thing to deal with, I guess. Through media and other things.

SPEAKER 4
OK, Yeah. So let's move on to our in person group. And, uh so So can we look back to the question?

SPEAKER 2
Uh, well, we can Yes.

SPEAKER 4
Who is that? Yeah, that's good. Thank you.

SPEAKER 6
I'll just I think so. We talk. We talk about the first question addressing. Like some of the countries say, developing countries like Indonesia, like developing countries, will not will not treat the, um, low carbon development this kind of growing and eco friendly issue as their priority. So So there's no enough incentives, I guess, for the developing countries to trans to trans to transform the industries. So so, no enough incentives. What can we do? What What can we do? We talk. What else?

SPEAKER 9
Like the bond from the like World Bank, those who all the, uh, organisations That's used particularly in, like the transformation in the like manufacturing sector. And, uh, like some countries, like in Europe and in China, there's like a carbon markets that's like the, uh, industry that needs a lot of, uh that in a lot of car.
