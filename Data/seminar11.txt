SPEAKER 1
Those are fundamental changes and, uh, are also needed in, uh, in developing their strategies but also approach, uh, in in embracing those kinds of challenges. And that challenge is real is actually happening right now, and many countries, perhaps and somehow are still kind of hesitating in a way of being, uh, uh, inactive in responding to that one. But, uh, again, you know, this is the, uh, credit pricing issue in terms of their strategy. Now, the lecture, we call this a balance of payments of constraint, growth, and in fact, before the, uh you know, approaching this issue, you have you you will be aware. You know, we are being doing this one arguing this one for for for some time already basically you know, the two gap model for exchange income. Sorry. The saving and the investment. So therefore, there's always a saying that the the balance of payment can be a, you know, constraint for economic growth. Later on, we will have a real example about the East Asian financial crisis. You know, 1997 98. That is a typical example to show that the balance of payments constraint, growth. If you have a key lesson from summarising, you know, the East Asian financial crisis. And, uh, that's it. That means the balance of payments have automated the constraint on economic growth. So if country handle this well, for example, you know, adjusting that strategy, the choice of a foreign exchange and dealing with the internal external issues, all these things that can be handled in a in in a good way. But however you know what happened in East Asian crisis financial crisis, it shows that, uh, you know, things can go wrong, is also, in a way, that they highlighting some kind of a weakness in the East Asian growth model massive growth model. But later on, we can see that, uh, what sort of problem you know with the balance of payment, and, uh, but that comes later. So for this lecture, I think it's quite important for students to to look at the, uh, the rather fundamental formula right for the the current account. So basically, the current account will be determined by two differences, right? One is a saving and investment. The other is, uh, sometimes, uh, you know, quite a quite neglected in a way. The is the is the government balance the balance of government expenditure versus a government revenue. The tax revenues These two balances can determine a country's fundamental position in terms of, uh, current account. Right? So last night, uh, as you probably know, Australia, uh, you know, Labour Government and the issue the, uh the, uh the budget, the third budget and, uh, talking about, uh, you know, in in fact, it's quite, uh, promising at the first, you know, look at the, uh, the surplus. And, uh, but again, you can see that down the track in the next 33 years, perhaps beyond there will be severe government deficit. The deficit means what the government revenue is not matched by, uh is not matching the government expenditure expenditure is more than the tax and revenue. So therefore the country tend to They tend to lead to some kind of, uh, you know, the balance of payment or current account deficit. And of course, if you have a very much a saving, which is overwhelmed larger than, uh, the investment, that's fine, right? Because they can oversize. But however, in many countries in the United States, for example, it's a twin deficit. The twin deficit means that, you know, this is there's a budget deficit, but also the deficit in terms of, uh, the overall. And, uh, of course, the government debt is all the issue are there? So So just to try to work out those kind of, uh, you know, balances and you can see how you can position a particular country in terms of, uh, in terms of, uh, the, uh, the the the current account. Why the current account is important because the current count is basically capture right. Those kind of, uh, the the the you know, the trade on the side. And there's also capital, uh, liberalisation, capital account balances. And, uh, because there can be a measure to see that uh, whether a country is actually running into some kind of a balance payments constraint, growth, you know, a constraint right on that one. So very important on that one. Then the lecture shift to, uh, you know, introduce a model, right? Very simple model in a way. But it's handy because on the left hand side is economic growth rate, and the growth rate overall is a determined, you know. Being determined by the very importantly is the improvement of the terms of trade. And this one I mentioned several times, right? And the terms of trade improvement. Why that is the part of sources of improving a country's welfare because you can see the PD minus PF. If that is a higher positive in a normal circumstance in the formula, you can see that can improve a country's growth. That's that's fine. But if the terms of trade being, uh, somehow, you know is a changing it also, it's not that simple, you know, when you have a terms of trade improvement but also depends on another two factors, right? That's the price elasticity for, you know, uh, of, uh, of, uh, export and the import and that E A and the sign. Right? So those are the, uh, very important one because, uh, because, uh, these two things the price electricity are negative in a way. But if you have an absolute value, the summation of this tool larger, greater than one, you can see the condition change will be very different in a way. So I'd like you to know these are two things. This one is, uh is the so called martial learner condition as you refer in the lectures. Martial learner condition holds the key for what? For the Li E at the second bracket. And, uh, that's the exchange rate. So exchange rate depreciation means that the E is a bigger, larger and, uh, is appreciation Is it a smaller? So you can see the gap between the PD minus PF and the minus E is actually is quite a subtle in a way because, uh, if you have a PD larger than PE a PF, that means that the exchange Sorry. The terms of trade improvement is, uh is there, But, uh, again, what the, uh the oversite forces is the exchange of depreciation. Normally, we understood if a currency depreciated, they can try to enhance a country What the The competitiveness of their export. Right? But so somehow this has to be following a certain condition that the condition is What is that? Uh, the martial learner condition is is a is a fine, because that is a minus, right? A minus. And overall, you can see two minor, right? Basically multiple become a positive, so that that's quite simple. You can go through that one in the lectures. I actually explain that one quite in detail. So you can You will follow the, uh, the lecture notes. You can see terms of trade income. Uh, demand. Sorry. Price a price, A for export and IUT, but also in the formula. We have a two income alys of demand, right? One is a P in the no in the denominator. But another one is if a salon on the top, if a salon is what it is very significant. In fact, you can use that one to explain what's going on right now in the global economy. Because all the country now try to somehow, you know, uh, adopting a policy which is a more or less a consistent import substitution meaning what? They try to produce the goods, which is, uh, satisfy their need by themselves in a way. But we know from the trade lecture, right, This is a rather inefficient and quite costly and causing enormous problem, the structural problem. And, uh, but country are doing that one. But from this formula, the if salon or that right, that tells us what the income growth from other country, which can, of course, subject to the income and assistive demand of other country on your goods, right, that can positively contributing to your own economic growth. So that's a very significant message from understanding. This formula is to say how the this is called the global or international interdependence means that means the growth of others is not bad for us. But right now, you know, American first decoupling and deris those kind of a policy actually worsen that situation. So in a way that, uh, you know, interdependence is actually the whole key for your own country's growth. This one, I think, is a very powerful message, very powerful in a way that is, You know, we are actually depending on each other, and that's what we meant by the globalisation. Right. So, uh, I think this is the formula. Also, tell us that one. So, uh, that's a very important message. Another way is that there is also the income ana of demand for import from other countries. That a A If that's a part, if it is a higher, you tend to lower your own growth. So this is the This is a fact. Right? So, uh, when you're demanding more from others, you know, you tend to, uh, you know, compromise your own growth. So therefore, you can use that formula. You can see there are so many factors, right? Can be, uh, can be, uh, considered in, uh, in discussing those kind of a balance of payments constraint, growth. And, uh, this is also related to one. When you talk about the depreciation, then immediately you are thinking about, uh, well, you have to have a certain condition. Right. So, uh, International Monetary Fund, they are advocating for countries. Yes, you can do it. But however, depreciation policy is a subject to the few other things. Right? Number one, can you remember? Is that the sources of difficulty, balance of payments of the difficulty is resulting for. This is a price competitive. It's not something you know as a structural problem. For example, if it is a structural problem, depreciation won't help you. So it has to be related to the price competitiveness. That's one thing. Second one is the, uh is again, you know, the current situation in many emerging and developing countries shows right, if you depreciate your currency that somehow you know you have especially for those countries have to import a lot of materials from a global market. So when you're doing that, one depreciation will have us, you know, causing the so called imported inflation. It can be a quite inflationary for those countries. So therefore, depreciation and that condition has to be accompanied by rather restrictive monetary and physical policy. Otherwise, inflation is just that, you know, you know, just so high. As we observed during the covid crisis, you know, you know, Turkey, for example, Argentina and South Africa, to some extent, East Asia is a better in a way. But, uh, again, you know, you can see the, uh, those situation depreciation of currency, imported inflation and, uh, making the macroeconomic policy adjustment so difficult within the country. So that's another concern about the depreciation. And, uh, so that's related the choices of the so called exchange rate. Right? We can see there's, uh you know, there's, uh, the, uh, the, uh uh, too extreme. Right in between intermediate and and how developing countries, there's pros and cons about each of the pack exchange rate, fixed exchange rate crawling in, and also the, uh, the very, uh, floating exchange rate. For many developing countries, moralises is a fixed or P the exchange rate, right. And, uh, but then you can see there's a one slide which is talking about the pros and the cons and, uh, in terms of the macroeconomic impact by resulting from a choosing a particular exchange rate. And that's actually quite useful. Right? So this is the lead towards the, uh what? We call this, uh, the East Asian financial crisis. Right. And, uh, you can see that, uh, many countries in East Asia at that time I had chosen, uh, the fixed exchange rate, right. So with the fixed exchange rate, basically, when you allow the capital to, you know, to flow right more freely in the way without a capital constraint. Then you are causing the of course, you're losing the independent of monetary policy, for one thing, but also it's a subject to the so called, you know, speculative attack. That means the the financial movement of the, you know, the the thing. And, uh, there is a one chart, uh, or two in the talking about, you know, these key, uh, countries in Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and, uh, Korea. And, uh and I think the Philippines also probably there. So there's a few countries that and, uh, it shows almost like all, especially Thailand. You can see in the bracket about, uh, balance of payments deficit. Uh uh, as a percentage in our total. Right. So Indonesia is a better, I think I remember it's not. But again, Thailand is, uh, something like the deficit in the current account surplus in total GDP is actually rising towards something like a 7% or even 8%. And, uh, that's extreme in a way. And it's not sustainable, sustainable. And, uh, many country is, uh, you know, try to meet that requirement because the is imbalance by using It's not a, you know, the the the foreign direct investment, but basically, by borrowing short term money, the lost portfolio, especially from international banks Korea is a typical example. So what? What happened in the in the In a real commodity market, which is actually sending a signal to to the investor seeing that, you know, perhaps this kind of a model based on heavy, heavy borrowing from a short term, you know, financial market or even the commercial banks may not be sustainable. And then the, uh, the speculator perhaps start do that whether country actually maintain that fix the exchange rate. And, uh, once they cast the dot on that one, you can see the panic you know happened, right, because the earth is a capital fly. So Malaysia is an example, right? And, uh um uh, Prime Minister, Prime Minister Mahathir at that time reimposing capital cons. Uh uh, control. And that is a very extreme measure. I remember that being kind of against the by mainstream economies, right. But in fact, in during the crisis, very dramatic measure to stabilise the financial market, and, uh, is, uh, is, uh, it's just one example to show that one. So the lesson for that one is that perhaps, uh, internally financial banking system reform. You have to build a very robust banking sector in the way. And, uh, the growth model, perhaps also is not so much, you know, You know, it's just a balancing of those two Gap model, right? If you are running short in terms of, uh, you know, saving in meeting your investment uh uh, you know, demand again. You know, you have to try to find a way of increasing savings, right? And, uh, rather, you know, continue to to borrow. We already touched upon the borrowing, you know, debt, uh, in the previous lecture. So those discussions are all very relevant in understanding why the balance of payments constraint growth is important, right? We already touched on that one. There's an internal one, but also the external sources for both of them. I think it is, Uh, is, uh, you can see the story. Perhaps the most become a more complete right, because right now you know it. Uh, many countries are facing the same problem, so you can identify whether there is something wrong with the domestic setting, the financial market and the banking sector. Uh, those reform or you know externally, the country are borrowing too much. And then in between you can see that what sort of exchange rate policy or the system they should use right in a way. And then there's a terms of trade. And then perhaps also the Marshall Learner condition, which is, uh, give us the idea about the price. Alas, for both import and export. When you have all these combined, you can see that's the That's the factors you know put together to determine the growth. So your economic growth of a particular country, it's not that simple, right? It actually depends on all of this. With an external open economy, there is no way you can avoid those kind of, uh, ideas, right, Those aspects. So, uh, so that's roughly about the first part of all the first part of the lecture. And then they I think from there, we can see the, uh, we also make some kind of assessment about the role of International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, especially IMF in, uh because IMF is somehow being designed right in dealing with one World Bank is designed in dealing with, uh, you know, the development issues but IMF The mission is to help the member countries in dealing with the the so called the balance of payments crisis. If you have a balance of payment crisis IMF will be the first one you know, to provide those kind of a lending. But somehow, during the Asian financial crisis, I have I have no idea about the crisis was the first coming and and when the crisis occurred and you have no way, you know, to say, Well, it's actually being caught by surprise saying that very slow in a way. And then when they recognise those a problem and then the Yeah, this is a song, uh, cannot be played

SPEAKER 2
in this theatre, so I'll just continue.

SPEAKER 1
Right, OK, so and, uh, we have rather slow so well, at that time the East Asia saying that no, let's let's try to help among ourselves And, uh, you know, have this kind of, uh, the policy, uh, idea. Thinking that, uh, can we just, uh, you know, establish the Y block because, uh, Asian economy using, uh, Japanese yen a lot, right? In a way. And, uh, but that idea being, uh, being blocked by the, uh the US saying that No, no, no. It's not a way to go, right, because, you know, US dollars position and etcetera and then, you know, they, uh and then East Asia, Uh uh, country of, uh, themselves kind of a formula. This kind of the charming, uh, in Thailand. There's kind of initiative, basically is to what? To, uh to, uh to manage the financial. Uh uh, kind of, uh uh, stress or the crisis by by exchange, the, uh, not the exchange, but by, uh, by changing this, uh, the position the foreign exchange position in helping the country in need. And that initiative continues until now. But somehow perhaps, uh, you know, need to be more kind of a formalised in a way and, uh, to to do so. But later on, of course, the crisis is over. So therefore, the the needs probably become a less and, uh, people always thinking that, you know, down the track, we need those kind of, uh, you know, future, uh, kind of a precautionary thing. It still probably need it in a way. And then there's a big picture about US dollar, you know, those kind of, uh and Now we have a geopolitical tension and Russia, you know, fighting the war, the sanctions. And so there's a lot of alternatives right happening. And, uh, especially using the renminbi, the Chinese currency, as a settlement as an alternative to restart the system, you have to restart the system. It will take a minute or 21 minute. A couple of minutes. Yeah, OK. Is that OK? Ok, so, uh, the recording will be It will be

SPEAKER 3
stopped for a couple of minutes.

SPEAKER 1
I see. So let's have a couple of minutes break to, uh, to for the system to be fixed. Yes.

SPEAKER 3
Thank you. So for all we will restart the system. All right, please join the session, like in two or three minutes. Sorry about that. You can go ahead. No.

SPEAKER 2
OK, so a little bit relaxed it like a if Someone from university.

SPEAKER 1
This is from camp, right? Sorry. Handled in this system. OK, um, I'm not sure if this the buildings are

SPEAKER 3
different. I'm not sure about that one. Yeah, so yeah, it seems still not still not working yet. Hm. It could be, uh, it could be a cable or something. Um, so the P the audio's working on the PC. Do you have a A laptop, I I If you do the meeting through the the laptop, you can use the, um all right. Yeah, but I, I don't have a iPad. Uh, at this moment. Yeah, OK, maybe I can let my student if they want to speak. Uh, they can speak through my iPad. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, maybe Yeah. Yeah. So the problem cannot be fixed at this moment. It can be fixed at this moment. Thank you. Test test for all students. Can you hear my voice? At least they can help. What do I say? You may recording is good. Well, it seems some problem cannot be fixed. But if later on when the students want to share the idea, they can share through my iPad. Yeah, I'll need to come back and have a look or something.

SPEAKER 1
Because it worked quite well.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, I'm not sure what happened. There could be some. We have another next week when you finished here.

SPEAKER 1
Here. Is that OK?

SPEAKER 3
We'll come back. And so the lecture can OK, Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
Sorry about this. Uh, maybe it looks like there's some kind of a problem with the system. But anyway, let's continue And, uh, yes, IMF. So, uh, when we talk about the IMF support it very much, very much liking. So a lot of our country regional country complained a lot about that one. But there is one issue which is associated with IMF support, uh, in helping our country running into the balance of payments. You know, those constrain the problem. That is the what can anyone remember? There's a There's a very There's a very big issue and, uh which, uh, countries are being supported by IMF are not happy. I'm not happy at all. In a way, this is a related to the one practise IMF is doing associated with their help. Another one is related to a principle. That principle is called the Washington consensus. And, uh so basically, the IMF imposing the so called conditionality conditionality means right? Yes, you can receive my support, but somehow you have to do these things. Those things are very much associated with the Washington consensus. That consensus are being shared by both International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Seeing that, you know, those are the principles, right? So, uh, uh, there's for some good reason, but somehow it didn't work very well. So that's why even in most cases Washington, the project based on following the Washington consensus, failed. Right? So that's why I talk about the post Washington consensus shortly, right? So, back to the conditionality, those conditionality basically refer to a lot of structural reform much, very much needed for good reason. Why? Because if you don't reform the system, you do the you know you're being helped right by the International Monetary Fund. Injecting quite quite handsome, you know, very substantial. You know, the, uh, the funding for those countries. But if you don't change in a fundamental way, perhaps, you know, the things will repeat right down the track. So for good reason. But, uh, those conditionality is in many cases, are quite harsh, quite harsh. And that's a particular happened in, uh, in dealing with, uh, Korea. And, uh, one day they ask Korea to do the readjustment. It's just terrible, right? You can see the movie at the time. I remember. You know, the, uh, the old older employee employees and working with a car assembly and the the the car factory have to close down as a part of a structural adjustment. He said this is the best facility in the world, right? How come you can close down this factory? So you couldn't understand what actually going on? Of course, at the time, as you know, the ordinary people of Korea donate, especially women donated their jewelries, right, the rings and all these things in helping this country. This is a good sentiment on part of ordinary people, but somehow they don't understand. Didn't understand what actually behind those changes, closing down and restructuring, et cetera. So those are related to Washington consensus. I have a slice in the lecture listing about the key elements of the Washington consensus. You know, you can see each individual of them and I can name a few. If you remember all of them, that will be very good. And, uh, to see the, uh, to see the, uh what actually going on right from a physical discipline, right. That means the imposing some discipline on government expenditure. Why that one? Because remember, in the at the beginning of the day, we mentioned about the government expenditure and the tax revenues, right? It's not matched So if you are re on the, uh, the government behaviour in terms of expenditure, you can correct that the balance. So that's why the physical discipline is important And that marketization right to force the, uh, you know, to to create a more competitive environment. Well, uh, in which, you know, the private, uh, entrepreneur can, uh, can flourish. And, uh, you have ownership, the reform, which is called the privatisation. That means that you have to, you know, to those kind of part of the structure reform, liberalisation of trade and, uh, private organisation and the decentralisation, you know, you know, decentralised give a lot of autonomy to local government and enterprises. You have also the, uh, the determination of a foreign exchange kind of a market driven and the determination of a setting a country's interest rate again. You know, based on the, uh, the supply and demand basically, in the market driven, you name it. So all these kind of suggestions, right? All contained in the Washington consensus are some are very relevant for those countries. Financial reform, for example, is another one. So those elements are individually and perhaps you look at that one all the countries need to need to be doing right as a result of that one. But however the crisis, when you have a very harsh conditionality imposed, you know, the country really struggling in a way. So that's why in some countries in some countries they prefer not have a support from IMF. Why is that? Why? Because they don't want to fulfil those conditionalities right by a very harsh reform and during a crisis. And that's why you know, the C initiative. You know, helping uh among the countries themselves is one way to go. But I'm never still there, you know, in time of a crisis, it's still there, you know, the the best help in a way, because the fundings are made available. But some country, of course, you know, the you have to return back. Those, uh, kind of a borrowing, right. The support from IMF. So the if you don't, uh, you know, repay back in in the time frame. As I said, you know, very difficult for those countries to continue in future to receive those kind of, uh, the support from IMF. That's why the developing country borrowed from IMF always have a priority of paying back the debt to IMF above anything else. The reason is very simple. If you don't do it, you know, down the track, it will be very difficult. You got a bad, bad record, so you you won't be able to borrow. And, uh uh uh, that way. So the countries are you know, one thing is about the condition. The other thing that you know, paying back the debt perhaps, uh, for for future, uh, consideration. So that's why the, uh after that, then the debate is shifting towards the so called the post Washington consensus is still consensus, but it's the It's not a Washington consensus, per SE. But looking at what actually needs to be done for those countries is especially in terms of a structural reform. And those structural reform is very much related to what we call the institutional building or the capacity building. So those support now is a shifting not just filling the gap between the balance of payment, right, but also shifting towards more on the human capital education right. For example, government training, government capacities, right in dealing with the issues and etcetera. So those are things are very much of one element of Washington consensus I didn't mention just now, which is again related to this one Washington consensus also have the so called the deregulation that is a very important element in that consensus rather deregulate. But somehow you know, in the transition or developing the phase of development, certain regulation will be quite quite, uh, you know, uh, useful in a way. So but the handling those one is basically the government people, right? So in a way, the capacity building for training So you can see there's a massive support the programme in Australia here you can receive all the delegation, right? All the training from China local government is a massive during that time because they're all being supported by that one at all level of government. This kind of a training so a U as a part of that one to play. But the most famous one is the is the Kennedy School in in at Harvard University, the continues until now, basically And also, uh, and of course, Singapore is also another model, and basically they have a claim. You know, they trained all the mayors or the deputy mayor in China already so. But anyway, so those capacity building training the public, Uh uh, sector people is a part of that one institutional building in the post Washington consensus. Right now, we don't have a very clear idea about how successful, you know, those, uh, post Washington consensus, the thinking and, uh, and also the application of that one. But eventually, perhaps after crisis and a crisis, right? And, uh, the crisis almost become unknown, right? So frequent, in a way. Big crisis and small crisis. So that makes this, uh, uh, developing country, the government. You know, it's not a puzzle, but, you know, because when you have a crisis, sometimes you are very you are not in a position, you know, to deal with this fundamental, like a structural reform. And and and, uh, but, uh, again, this is the situation, uh, at the moment. And then as a related to so called this is in a textbook about, uh, the Beijing consensus. Right. Talking about, uh, you know, those government support and thinking about the public, Uh uh, interest rather than just a private interest and all these things? Uh, you can disagree with that one, But as I said earlier, it's not a conclusive right now in thinking about what sort of strategy developing country need at the moment, right after the crisis of the crisis. This is the, uh this is the subject I'm going to talk about in the final, uh, seminar next week. And, uh, so that's my request that perhaps before you come, please do listen to the final lecture, the recorded lecture. So, uh, next week I won't go through all the messages from myself and also from the the author of the textbook professors. And, uh, but, uh, please listen to that one. And then I can, uh, talk about, uh, the covid and the with the developing country. You're facing those kinds of challenges what the developing country need to do as a part of a conclusion of the whole lectures, Uh, next week. So, uh, that's roughly about the lecture. And, uh, so let me go through, uh, quickly, uh, about our seminar topic. And, uh, so before I do any question, all right. So, uh, let's let's go on with this one. No, this is the the basically, they call it industrial 4.0. Right. So it's happening right now. And the impact on the pattern of development is, as I mentioned earlier, this is a real This is happening very real and also happening very quickly. And, uh, all the countries now, uh, both country, you know, government and private sector, but also individual now have to think about how to embrace those kind of a new era in which we have those artificial intelligence, right, The big data and, uh, increasingly and have, uh, imposing a lot of shocks to the existing system. And, uh, in fact, to the individual, uh, the well being as well. So you can see the anxiety and everything. So the question we raised, that is what is the role of industrial revolution? You know, this is the in transforming production. What is the fourth industrial? You know, revolution. What are the main benefit of that one? What are the cost of that one? What are the challenges? This is the important one facing developing countries in embracing the new digital technology. And again, that's a religion. Next week, I'm going to talk about this. You know, the new way of industrialization, talking about a great growth and this is the out of necessity, right? That means you cannot go with all the way of industrialising. Why? Because the climate change, you know, added another dimension imposing that constraint. You can't do it. And, uh, but with that one, whether there's a big gap in terms of, uh, you know, designing their strategy, embracing the new challenges but also dealing with a lot of old or existing challenges faced by the developing country. Now this is the the Industrial Revolution transforming the production since the 18 hundreds. You know, we have experience of three industrial revolutions. Each was powered by the disruptive new technology disruptive in. It means that you disrupt right the old way of doing business. The mechanics of the steam engine, the innovation of the assembly line and the speed of the computer. The reason they were called Industrial Revolution was because what because the innovation that drove them didn't just improve productivity and efficiency a little bit. In fact, there's a lot it completely revolutionised how goods were produced and how work was done. In fact, how the life lived is all being affected by those, uh, industrial revolution. So it's quite a significant. So happening is just happening that are, you know, this generation of people or the several generations kind of, uh, you know, living through that a dramatic change. So, in a way that, uh, it's quite a significant. This chart is actually quite useful in a way to think about the technological progress and the transformation. So again, you can see. Can you see it at the back? Yeah. So, uh, you know, this is the basically three things. The transformation in three form very early on in history is transforming materials, right? Stone tools, bronze iron to going through, right. The second state is basically transforming energy That is ongoing, right? Until now, Basically, you can You can, you know, name it. Water, power, steam, power, electrical power, Combustion power until now is the new solar and the new energy sources is ongoing. Right? And towards now, what will happen? What happened before is the transforming information. We're not dealing with so much about the material, even though we are still doing that one. And the energy as I mentioned, is unfolding. It continue to do the new energy sources right impacting on so many countries. Uh, policy, right? Those are not economic, but also foreign policy, trade policy, investment capital and all these are all related is continue to do so and, of course, to the benefit of the world as a whole. Right, Because the, you know, new energy sources and, uh, can be, uh, you know, can be still power those kind of a new industrialization without really causing so much pollution, right? So that that's the way and, uh, not finished yet at transforming energy. But now with the 4.0 we're actually in the process of transforming information, which is basically big data and transfer that one. You know, you know, housing the productivity probably enormously. And this is the expectation, right? So if if not, we have a problem. So there has to be very, uh, conducive to those kind of, uh, the, uh the productivity concerns. So, uh, it's quite interesting to look at those changes, right? The transformation happening nonstop, but somehow, from, uh, materials to energy and to information, right. So even though you're transferring energy, But again, a lot of materials continue to be there overlapping and, uh, in the in that process of transforming those things. Now what is the the fourth industrial Revolution that, uh, you know, 4.0 the ongoing automation of a traditional manufacturing and industrial practises using modern smart technology. So there's a basically two things. One thing is that when you have this, uh, a I basically that created a new industry, as we can see, with a lot of the related to that one the virtual world, right? All related, but also using that technology to transform the existing manufacturing or the old manufacturing. So which is actually quite significant in a way? And, uh, there are many dimensions on that one. The big data A I analytics horizontal and vertical integration cloud computing AED the reality industrial Internet of things. Uh, there's a you know, 3D painting and the autonomous robot. All these, uh, the things right. And, uh, it's related to 4.14 0.0. Now, the potential impact on growth is the following, right, the rise of a big data and the underlying those kind of, uh, ability to capture and analysing data data set from a highly diversified con context and generate a novel and anticipated knowledge. A surveillance of a I There is an article I can't remember very. In a detailed thing is anticipated the knowledge that you don't know yet right when this artificial intelligence are is happening. You know, this is basically the vis a vis humans, right? But importantly is that for us is to to get more knowledge in a way. And but a lot of things, actually, we still don't know yet because we don't know that the potential right And, uh, and a way of acquiring the knowledge, processing the information. And, uh, and for human use, a lot of things is still unknown. So? So an anticipated knowledge as well as a I and development relying on data are capable of producing economical growth and bringing relevant benefit both at the social and individual levels. So this is the, uh, the good things, right? We know we are conducive. And, uh, but right now, as you know, the, uh, the I think the United States now come up with the the very first regulation legally bonded, imposing on this, uh, a I you know, those, uh, new sector new development. And because of the potential concern right about that eventually perhaps a lot of the regulations uh, will be issued. And in responding to those challenges, this rapidly sprawling phenomenon is expected to have a significant influence on governance. So it doesn't matter whether you're you're learning public policy or economics and economic security, science, education, health care and much more so almost like all the area and all our concern are somehow being impacted by those new technology. And, uh, so that's why we have to for developing country discussing those topics have to embrace those one. So those are the, you know, the, uh, the main benefit being summarised in the 23 things, right? Basically the optimisation, you know, the optimal. Uh, as you know, the, uh, economic term right is basically related to, uh, the efficient work. In a way, you optimise the things right and you optimise those operation in, uh, old frame. But now we have this, uh, the, uh, the the tools basically available, right to help help us doing that way. And, uh, so basically intelligent products will be available. Right? Development connected self-aware products that are capable of sharing information about their, you know, people's health, location, usage level storage conditions. And the more so those things are. I was kind of a joking with a friend the other day we talk about we kind of perhaps eventually we lose all the privacies because the big data, you know you can even now you you are you do the internet right when you are have a particularly interest area and immediately you can see that all the you know, the programme right to send to you the all the related programme because they they capture your preferences. Your preferences are being shown by the big data. So therefore they can organise all the products available to you, which is to satisfy your need in in the way and, uh, location and everything. So in a way that, uh, again the privacy and the security is is a real issue. You probably won't believe that there's a newspaper article was seen that in Australia, every single minute we have a five thou $5000. Uh, you know, subject to scans, you know, being lost I. I won't believe that way. It's just too much. But this is the data, so you can see those security impacting on people billions of dollars every year, you know, subject to this scam. And, uh, this is the downside, right? But that comes later on. Now, the intelligent factories, this is the, like, a dream in before, right? How come you can see the, uh, the factory being, you know, run by the robot in a very smart way, Perhaps the most efficient one you know, in the public governors, uh, discussion MBAS. We're talking about the business model, right? One of the important element of that one is what is to monitor, right? Remember the principal agent discussions You monitor workers, right? And the ownership have a special, uh, contract arrangement in monitoring the CEO S and for their performance. But for those smart protections, right by robot, there's no need. 24 7, right. There's actually no need for monitoring. And the monitoring is so costly in a way, it's so costly. And in governors, right, But right now, probably no run a small factories, highly digitalized, largely autonomous facility that take full advantage of advanced technology, like a big data, artificial intelligence, robotics and, uh, analytics and, uh, you know, Internet of things. So those are the things can radically change the business model. The way you run business. Basically. So, uh, that's that's quite a challenging Uh uh uh, things right. Intelligent asset. Almost every physical asset deployed today has a building sensors which were connected to the, you know, the internet things. Analytics are a game changer for enterprise asset Management. It is a game changer in the way. And, uh, of course, finally, that's a kind of empowered people, right? We hope, rather than, you know, the, uh, to replace people and to empower people to deal with that one. So that's the, uh, the optimal science about this, uh, embracing those technologies. Now, what are the cost? Uh uh, Already mentioned by what? You know, the security is, uh, one of the most important one. And, uh, capital is the, you know, new, uh, technology have to be, you know, being invested by by people. So therefore, that's why employment that's the, uh, again, it's not just for rising unemployment, but, uh, it's actually workers need to acquire the different and all new set of skills. So that's a tremendous, uh uh, demand for training. And that training can be made available to everyone. And it's not just, you know, talking about the developed or developing countries. It doesn't matter how far you know remote. You know, your location are so long as you have, uh, Internet, right? And you can get access to those kind of, uh uh, training and, uh, probably very soon. In fact, it's already happening. And, uh, So, uh, have you heard about the the, you know, academy Can academy and, uh, so many young people using that one so systematic in teaching in everything. And, uh so it's already there for years now. And I read the article, uh, in January, there is in Japan time. And now, when I was travelling and, uh, the article was saying that he himself actually now leading to get a A I into his academy of training. And, uh so eventually, I think, highlighting the role of not so much about the teacher now because the teacher probably were very place but emphasising the role of tutors. So, uh, and Nicola, you will become a very important Why is that? Because then the tutor can you know easily digest all these things right? The student need is actually responding to the course content and help like with a with a tutor. so eventually we will become a tutor. But anyway so and the privacy, other issues. And, uh, so what's liking in developing countries? In in BRI, those kind of challenges in developing has no interest with the benefit using your your iPad. But I hope recording is not being OK going out.

SPEAKER 2
I drop my iPad anyway, so the probably the system

SPEAKER 1
doesn't like what I said. So can you still use the university's Wi Fi?

SPEAKER 3
I think it's It's University University problem, So I'm also

SPEAKER 1
done. So can we record? No, no, no recording. That's fine. So we recorded already be stored so But now I

SPEAKER 3
cannot hear what we say and I say, OK, so

SPEAKER 2
all of that and basically that phenomenon because the line

SPEAKER 1
and that guy has to be fixed. We feel very way of doing that right now.

SPEAKER 2
Because of the unique feature of artificial I Internet connection can help so previously so difficult. You have to send people there money organised. All is a project in previous to talk three, and,

SPEAKER 1
uh, well, you can have this Internet connection and, uh,

SPEAKER 2
how you organise the wall. You can actually deal with that challenge and you learn. And, uh, I also emphasised that the I and knowledge is relevant to for development country because they are the core is a level of development. And, uh, but it's a, uh Maybe, in some sense,

SPEAKER 1
I have my education, right.

SPEAKER 2
But also the changing part, Ma, as there is the

SPEAKER 1
traditional way of learning and certain people, but those can

SPEAKER 2
be overcome by those kind. So therefore, the learning curve, you know, for the you

SPEAKER 1
know, can be, uh, can be there very high.

SPEAKER 2
And, uh, another one is that, uh I think the new challenges is not just a I, as we mentioned before, uh, climate change, so many other dimensions. So the new strategy for developing need to be, in

SPEAKER 1
a way to concern, right?

SPEAKER 2
And, uh, and the angle, you probably just focus on the particular the big picture is what? And now So, uh, I think probably that's all the,

SPEAKER 1
uh Oh, we can steer you back online, but it's all right, So, uh, we didn't miss a lot. So, uh, what is the liking? You know, the help reach even those not readily accessible places and compare information that can then be added to the you know those data. So that means it's exactly the point I just mentioned, you know, the big data can help us. And, uh, the things that we mentioned is about, uh, the learning curve, right? For very poor country, even though we see there is a digital divide, but somehow utilising Well, you know, those countries can catch up more quickly in terms of those technology knowledge and, uh, and etcetera. So it's like something is lacking but also can feel. And there's a couple of examples about the health care industry and how you know those, uh, uh, big data technology can help us skip that one. There is also the agricultural industry, and, uh, it's just amazing about how the technology can happen. Right. And, uh, we have, uh, you know, colleagues working with, uh, with the government A and, uh, years ago. He's not joined us. And years ago, you mentioned about those, uh, the, uh the, you know, the the planting by farmers, right. Using machines. Right. Previously, it just my machine going through the field. But now that each you know, the the sees it actually being controlled by the in the satellite it is. I think it is quite amazing why they want to do that. Because this year you planted in this way, right? And the next year, the cite will make adjustment for the seeds to be planted in a very unique uh uh, different positions in a way to maximise, uh, you know, the those, uh, the, you know, the the F, Uh, the land, in a way. So those kind of technology can enormously increase the productivity of the agricultural sector. So, uh, so, farmers, of course. You know, this, uh, will be very beneficial, uh, for that one. And those are the challenges finding means to overcome the digital divide. I already mentioned that one security capital investment, which is, uh, again, the old issue. Right. As we mentioned, uh, before the, uh, the old issue about this, uh, the gap to Gap model and, uh, to mobilise resources domestically and also boring, you know, cautiously from overseas. And, uh, so dealing with the pressures on employment. So, uh, from now on, perhaps you know, the automation, the industrial robot, and, uh, to a great extent that can replace their workers, right? And, uh, not just blue collar workers, but also white collar workers. Right as we know it, they have a list of people uh, can be easily or readily replaced by machines and, uh, a lot of actually, including the white collar workers and, uh, so building a new infrastructure to increase the connectivity. OK, you know, you you do have this kind of Internet, right? Five G and also laying out and the connectivity are so, so crucial, uh, investing in human capital the same thing. But whether we have a different meanings of investing in human capital what sort of a knowledge? The skill we need right in in increasing those new challenges. And, uh so a lot of things you you don't have to memorise anymore. A lot of things you don't have to. Of course, it's a practise. Uh, you know, computing is OK, but, uh, you know, computer can do such a job, right? So, in computing job, unless you you really want to, uh, have this kind of, uh, you know, the brain, the exercise in a way, building, uh, getting public policy right to deal with the cost of adjustment. That's an enormous challenge, right? For government the policies and, uh, to be put in place and, uh, in in dealing with an adjustment adjustment can be very challenging in unemployment, for example, right. And, uh, the the requirement of those, uh, acquiring those those the knowledge and the skills, right, Proper training of people. And it's all being a part of that one adapting institution to get incentive right for innovation is ongoing thing. It's not a new and, uh right institution, right incentive and the right outcome. So in a way, that is the, uh to to go through that way institution building. But in a in A with a new meanings and reaping the benefit from international cooperations. This is also very important for developing countries. And even though we have a covid, even though we have a kind of a thinking about those, uh, you know, the self sufficiency and et cetera. But, uh, again, you know, is the, uh we have the trend of a deg globalisation, but in a way that I think I believe, you know, the reintegration and the Reg. Globalisation still holds the key, and for the world, global communities, countries involved to deal with all sorts of new challenges and the individual country, developing or develop cannot handle those challenges themselves, you know, has to be through Cooper operation and embracing those new technology. Industrial 4.0 is the same thing, like international cooperated regional Cooper operation. And so there's so much, you know, the issues has to be dealt with through that one. And, uh, but that's the way to go. And, uh, what's the United Nations recommendation in that regard? The first string of promoting innovation to fill the data gaps, you know, is all there. But, you know, try to do mobilising resources to overcome inequalities between developed and developing countries and between data poor and the data rich country. So eventually, perhaps those data, the big data can be shared more freely or made available to the later commerce, where they have this lack of development in data, you know, collection and processing and cetera. And for each country you know it. It's already very much advanced in those development, leadership and coordinations to enable the data revolution to play this full role in the realisation of a sustainable development. This is quite a powerful message, because what we concern you know in teaching this course and eventually, you know, we know the goal of development is for the sustainable development, right? But now, whether we can actually tap in those big data new technology, connect that one with the goal of sustainable development. This is actually the message I'm going to try to tell you in the conclusion next week is about those big thinking, the big ideas right and why this is so useful. Because that can connect now. So United Nations already pointed out seeing that you know the leadership is needed. But very importantly, the coordinations is also needed to enable that revolution to play. Not just a small role is a full role in the realisation of a sustainable environment. That will be the idea of all. Come. I can tell you all the things we learned throughout this course about the development. This and that. Right? The challenge of the theory, the practise, the policy, all these things. Right now we have a industrial 4.0 is kind of a cut there, right? So we have to realise that one now, the message here that that one can be connected to the goal reaching the goal of a sustainable development. Well, we now we can see the leadership. We can know the coordinations, but there's so much more. That's the message that came to you as a student learning, you know, the development economic. It's so much there to fill in the gap to link those technology what we need. There are many, many, many other dimensions, many other issues, the challenges, right. So those are with, you know, with the knowledge you have learned from this course about the development economic. Now you are in a position right to explore. So we are not expecting you. You just get a knowledge, memorise the thing and, uh, get the exam done and answer those questions. Uh, my expectation is much more than that is much more than that. So, uh, and those in thinking about those very noble goals and very pressing challenges And, uh so and then utilising the knowledge you have learned in connecting up. So when I read this one, I said, Wow, you know, this is the things where I need to convene to my students because they need to know that one. And it's not a small part. You know, particularly theory and the knowledge etcetera it. It's a very broad, very grounded grand ideas about, uh, to utilise your knowledge and, uh, linking back to the goal of development. This is actually the message. I'm going to convince you next week, but, uh, since already here. So I just mentioned that one. The question we have is the what are the beneficial impact on growth and development, the use of digital technology? Just find out. You know, those things. Identify those things as I mentioned. You know, the learning curve is one of them, right? And you don't have to to learn. Remember the industrial revolution, right? Each industrial revolution, you you can see the duration of that one is much shorter. That means that the speed of learning is so more rapid. And according to Nicholas, uh, no. Uh uh. Douglas North right. The speed of learning is to determine what the speed of economic growth and the performance. So now you can connect with those things, right? So what are the main challenges for developing countries to embrace the digital technology I have just online. Right. So you can do that one. Is there a trade off, not trade off between efficiency and equity, but trade off between productivity and employment in application of digital technology, especially for developing countries and for everyone. But if you believe there's a trade off, or perhaps through the discussion of policies seeing that there is no trade off, that would be ideal. But everyone may, you know, worry or concern about that trade off. But, uh, again, that can generate a lot of a good discussion, Uh, for for that one, that's all for me and, uh, the, uh keep that question in mind. And, uh, let's have a about 20 minutes discussion, and then we can, uh, share some ideas. So before we do, let me, uh, make, uh, a two announcement. And, uh, the number one is that we have, uh, exam the final exam. The date is, uh, being set already. And, uh, we are going to use, like, uh, any other part of university the so called system of a post. And the system is actually can allow us to monitor and all these things. And, uh, we have, uh, uh, two year now drafted, uh, the instruction for to carry out the exam We also want to use a few minutes of your time to practise, because otherwise you feel you feel, uh, kind of maybe shocked right when the exam happened. So to do a bit of practise takes about 10 minutes. And, uh, so, which is will be very useful, You know, how does the system rise? So, uh, enable you to to get in? Yeah, In the mode. Doing the exam? Uh, rather smoothly. Right. So, uh, Friday or I will post to the office by tomorrow. So you you are aware of the instruction, and then you can do a bit of practise, right? So it will be very useful. Second message is that the, uh, the, uh, the the final, uh, essay to you is on the 27th, right? Is the, uh So, uh, for those students who really still, you know, doing that one. So you have to Yeah, hurry up a bit. And because it's, uh, not much time left. And, uh, So if you have a question, please do ask us, and, uh, the, uh uh uh, TUI and the mark were organised. We organise a special workshop in, uh, helping your students to polish your writing and that perhaps something. Uh, tomorrow afternoon. Uh, I I'll make announcement through water when I know the time. Probably 123 or 3 to 4. But anyway, so very short work workshop will be very useful for those who are they have a draught or almost finish your draught So you can see how to polish Because, uh uh, we don't have a position to read every draught before you hand me either. You know, Nicola and, uh, two year we won't be able to read the draught anymore. We can make you com comments on some kind of idea and the issues, right. But we don't read the draught, and, uh, just too many of them. So but, uh, come to the workshop, and tomorrow afternoon, if you have that also, uh, going through online as well. So you can just, you know, just less than an hour. But you know how to polish your writing. OK, that's another one. So when you submit, this is the message I'm going to probably next week. But better, uh, talk to now when you submit is, uh you have the opportunity, right? So you use that opportunity and make every year some students send the wrong version essay to to to to turn it in. So make sure the one the version you said is the final version and not the paper or essay. You know, prepare for another course mixed up. Because a lot of writing that you do. So I understand. So make sure very, very clear mind before you you submit. OK, that's another one. So final message is that I already mentioned in fact, is that I hope you you listen to the recorded lecture 12 for you come next week. Because I, I won't repeat those messages. And, uh, I can focus more on the covid and developing countries. The big picture, uh, issues. And, uh So, uh, next week, probably. And, uh, we don't have this, uh uh, seminar, uh, tutorial discussion. So after I finish, and, uh, I will be here and, uh, to answer you any question you may have. All right. OK, so, uh, let's affirm, I think. Yes, please.

SPEAKER 2
Yeah. Entertaining it is a practise test. So you just want to install the material you need to the, uh, pa. Basically, that I just want to uh, can you 15. You don't You don't even outside the country and any and any. Yeah, OK, I, I suggest perhaps, uh, let's suspend the

SPEAKER 1
can organise the group. No. Yeah, And, uh, maybe maybe one group Pause recording now for now, Yes, I will send you to the breakout

SPEAKER 3
room And you have around 15 to 20 minutes as

SPEAKER 4
we as we all reckon, that we got into the area of industry 4.0. How do you feel? Like artificial intelligence that can shape the political structure or the legislative structure. This kind of like the the politics is like the cornerstone of strength. So we we kind, uh, cultivate politics for for thousands of thousands of years. And but a I is an emerging emerging method. I can say it's a measure that we cannot take full use of what we can we can somehow that's

SPEAKER 1
the That's the question.

SPEAKER 2
So I reckon that the less to number TV is

SPEAKER 1
OK, right? Just come to this corner.

SPEAKER 2
So, uh, the the questions are there.

SPEAKER 1
So this is how about that?

SPEAKER 2
And did that essay already or on this? Still driving off in our OK? Yeah, well there. $12. I think you've done our population. How much they need? No. First. Yeah. That was one of the challenges that that India faced post covid. Um, when it came to transfer. Not a great dog, I think. God to that's specifiable. Um, can all OK, so about, sir, you make just feel this. Yeah, about, uh, that's exports of those open source uh, model, which is the the eye Because of security reasons you don't allow to on those your heart, the US government. Some nice to those. Yeah, let me start up. You still the selected two bottles? The don companies? Bye. I think the US standing in sports today I to work? No, Just very hot. Yeah, To somewhere to upload those things on the internet and other It just means basically what? Very hot. So I'm just a very black OK based on I thought of that. The right part of the land it is. It is not always popular. May raise some concern about something Might prioritise my mega province. Can anyone do the job that like, out of Yeah. Oh, yeah, I know somebody. Who when she was in a girl she counted and that's how they knew. How many reasons? Dictionaries who was less private. Yeah, and they are beautiful for the writing he would never prediction is maybe what the questions wanted to Yeah, requires Maybe you don't few. Plus, it's hard to imagine a government if the technology is meaning Going to brother the of innovation OK or to prevent. So is it possible that some OK measure and all from No. Ok, no. OK, coffee. All right? Yeah, but this problem between an hour and the information is just wrong. When are they You study in the university. The whole instead of actually and C the this presumably though OK, so absolutely. Yeah, OK, maybe it's still happening for wars. It's not me. You can find it in terms of the It's free now, Yeah, use the you know, in different countries like Indonesia, technology when we face sewing, it is going to and the technology is helping, especially in my industry. Progress in can make the mist run, even become the face. It helps to improve the productivity in the hard times when copy the or the original music like cast requires. Let me just see Uh, yeah, the same. My Or see you. The mhm. Mhm. Don't feel that. So you or anything? OK, Yes, Exactly. True question three. Yeah, I So it is.

SPEAKER 1
Well, you know, the actually you probably looks like teachers.

SPEAKER 2
The first occupation features the first one to talk on this. And that's why I mentioned about the T. Because the little of the subject. And but I I'm afraid Interaction concept. Very simple. Don't look up always and there is, you know, the shot the car Go to Asia. I eat you call online for three years. So exciting. But, you know, we actually through the process. OK, that's a student.

SPEAKER 1
Let me finish. That's OK. Yeah.

SPEAKER 2
Mhm. Is that Use this from here. I do this last night, right? And this I when? Ok for the, um this, um see, mhm parties. Six months? No. OK, anyway, tax return. Oh, give me, uh no, my address. They didn't really watch the the budget speech filler that So the total Oh, OK. Australian Mhm. So yeah, back to me. Recording.

SPEAKER 1
Start recording?

SPEAKER 2
Yeah.

SPEAKER 1
All right. So, uh, we have a still have about 10 minutes. And, uh so let's see uh, give it the opportunity to an online group to have a say. Yeah, please. Any representative from online group would like to share your

SPEAKER 3
ideas.

SPEAKER 1
Alex. So, male. Isha, honey.

SPEAKER 2
So, Mike, would you like to share your idea?

SPEAKER 3
Oh, it doesn't work here, right? I need to use my Oh, it didn't work.

SPEAKER 2
I see. OK, so regarding the impact of the digital technology and

SPEAKER 5
growth, it can help to increase productivity, reduce error in hand efficiencies. And it can allow for the improved accessibility to information and services and enhance the connectivity between the people and business, like field of facilitation, communication and collaboration, and also increase more employment opportunity. Type of, uh, tech related fields such as IT support software development. Uh, last but only also in hand. The public service, like government, can use technology to improve their, uh, service delivery in transparency and corruptions. And the key man is that when we implement a new technology, there used to be a regulations to sexual rights to protect uh uh, the G and, uh, financial information in place. Like it can be a, uh, occur through the cyber security. So we do need those regulations and rule, and they have more capacity in terms of, uh, human capital, uh, in related to technology. And there are indeed a lot of investments to develop the infrastructures of the technologies. There can be a deficit. Uh, if the, uh, try to improve one K to one K, and this is Ah, wait. Ah. If from the government side they receive, uh, there will be a loophole that they do need more leadership people to understand how beneficial of the technology to implement to the citizen or to the patients. And this, like, takes some time to adapt. Um, for people or citizen in country to adapt the new technology and the trust, Uh, they trust fully it it like it will be, uh, working in the future effectively and effective or not. And the last question is, uh, the trade between the productivity and employment of the technologies that while we increase more of productivity, it did we have the those things more convenient, But, uh, some people, they great ah, delivery layoffs. And we replace the people with the other people of the machines because they require more higher skill, internal, uh, technology and IT support and stuff. And, uh, so scale is much and still shift, like they they have to consider a car. And also interventions between government and the private sector to measure our technology can implement, uh, safely and effectively. So thank you for listening. And that's all the life. Uh, and our discussion. Thank you.

Oh, yeah. Just, uh, just wanna keep going with my question. So it seems like so I I shaped shaped the industry. The structure of the industry. Um, quite a lot. But I feel like for in in the political structure say we know it's quite solid. No, nothing can can can shape it in in several centuries, centuries or decades, it has been formed from from from ancient Greek. I think so. At that time. I, I feel I feel like, um it it's kind of really hard for for a I to, um to facilitate us, to do any of the PO to do any of the political decisions. So I think it can facilitate us to make economic boo at first. But it's still cut to to to to to kind of shape and then cultivate the political structures in some in a way that still be discussing, you know, Asian
